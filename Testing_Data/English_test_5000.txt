I am particularly delighted that my amendment to reduce the level of withholding tax from % to % has been adopted for three reasons
Firstly too high a rate would harm investment and therefore also growth and employment
Secondly the rate of withholding tax applied in international tax agreements only rarely exceeds %
Thirdly too high a rate would make all attempts to limit capital flight completely futile
The aim of the directive is to prevent capital flight to EU Member States where rates are higher
So how can we prevent capital from seeking out more favourable tax environments
From this perspective choosing a rate of % as suggested by the French Government would be an economic error that would run counter to the objective of fighting harmful tax competition
In this respect I am delighted with the proposal by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy to begin negotiations with neighbouring countries on fiscal matters
It has also been suggested that these discussions could then be extended to include the OECD members
This being the case it is good that the European Union is not making the outcome of these discussions a precondition for implementing the directive on taxation of savings
There are enough stumbling blocks already without adding others
I will therefore vote in favour of the resolution and the proposal for a directive provided that no amendment is adopted to modify my proposal for a withholding tax of %
As the House approves the % and does not deem it necessary to first reach an agreement with our neighbouring countries I am voting against the report
Tax policy is for the most part a national matter
However dumping through unfair tax competition where the aim is to avoid paying tax should be tackled by means of European rules provided minimum rules are applied
I have therefore voted in favour of the report
I voted against the Pérez Royo report on taxation of savings because it is the best way to ensure that savings leave the European Union
New York and Zurich which are already rubbing their hands will be the main beneficiaries of this suicidal relocation operation Zurich in particular when it comes to European collective investment undertakings within the meaning of the directive
To top it all it is only the collective investment undertakings that are targeted with the result that the promoters will try to relocate outside the EU in order to continue to sell collective investment undertakings to their European customers tax-free
This will mean the end of many of the European collective investment undertakings
You will have promoted tax evasion outside the Community and internal tax revenue will be non-existent
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has turned a deaf ear
None of my amendments were adopted and my arguments against the ridiculous administrative burden proposed were not heeded
This enormously expensive red-tape for the paying agents will in itself create competitive disadvantages in terms of management costs and will result in collective investment undertakings leaving the EU
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy like Mr Monti is also turning a deaf ear to the need at the same time to take measures equivalent to those adopted in a Community directive in third countries that are likely to attract EU capital
If the directive was introduced it should apply above all to the dependent or associated territories of certain Member States and also where these Member States have particular responsibilities or tax prerogatives
The real tax havens within the Community are Monaco San Marino Andorra the Channel Islands the Netherlands Antilles and so on
Surely you do not believe that as Mr Poos the Luxembourg Minister has just stated in our Chamber of Deputies my country is prepared to agree to a fool bargain and to be the only one to play the unenviable role of the sacrificial lamb on the altar of rigged tax harmonisation
Moreover do not forget that there can be no question of abandoning our condition that the fiscal package put together on December under the Luxembourg Presidency should apply across the board
Long live unanimity
This is a classic example of tax harmonisation
First there was harmonisation of VAT and excise duties
Since then the European Commission has been dragging out its plans to harmonise corporate tax and above all to harmonise taxation of savings especially as the single currency has heightened the distortions between many tax systems with all the risks of relocation and competition between them
Being a poor loser the Commission has tried to guard against the fiscal dumping that is inherent in free movement by means of its European Code of Conduct which is in fact only a cartelisation code for tax authorities in order to maintain the oligopoly
It is against this background that we have the Pérez Royo report on the proposal for a directive of June which clearly aims to set a ceiling on taxation of savings income in order to counter the Luxembourg tax haven
There would be a dual ceiling either the application of a % rate of taxation on interest payments or the supply of information
Taxation or information
The choice would be between paying the withholding tax and being subject to taxation in the Member State of residence
This is what we call the model of coexistence the coexistence of states that apply the withholding tax regime and states that do not
But that does not solve the problem of globalisation
Capital moves around even beyond Europe
The problem exists for Eurobonds which may be underwritten by investors outside Europe
Hence the proposal from Professor Pérez Royo for a multilateral agreement with Japan Switzerland and the US
This shows how outdated Europe is the tax village is becoming global
In terms of capital globalisation is complete
European taxation is therefore obsolete
It can only apply to taxpayers whose residence is fixed and localised with the glaring injustice that we all know so well
Europe without frontiers overtaxes labour income to make up for not being able to tax capital income
This is why the Europe of free movement is a Europe that deprives people who are permanent residents in favour of nomads
Britain Labour MEPs support the principles behind the Commission proposals to prevent tax evasion on cross-border payments of interest to individuals
However these proposals as currently drafted are flawed and against the interests of employment in Europe financial services industry
The timing of the introduction of a withholding tax directive is crucial
Unilateral European Union level action runs the genuine risk of creating an outflow of capital to third countriesfor example Switzerland
Should this happen then jobs in EU financial centres will be lost to third countries as capital leaves
In addition there will be no benefit to exchequers as the taxable interest payments will be outside the Member States
It is not appreciated that Eurobonds or international securities are included within the scope of the directive
Such a move would also run the genuine risk of relocating the whole Eurobond market outside of the EU and in particular the City of London
British Labour MEPs are acutely conscious of the New York experience of imposing a unilateral tax on such financial services
For many years Eurobonds were almost exclusively traded in New York The introduction of a unilateral tax regime saw their near total relocation to London
As currently drafted therefore this directive poses a direct threat to between and jobs mainly in London financial services depending on whose analyses you believe
Indeed there are already clear indications of Swiss preparations for any new opportunities that may arise as a result of EU action
British Labour MEPs will be supporting calls for a multilateral policy development with the other OECD financial centres to tackle this important issue of tax evasion and for the exclusion of Eurobonds from this directive
In the absence of such amendments being carried British Labour MEPs will vote against this directive
Both the Commission proposal and the Pérez Royo report on introducing a minimum level of taxation on savings income undoubtedly deserve our support
Especially now with the single currency and the absence of any exchange risk this is the only way to rule out predatory fiscal competition
We must however be vigilant about competition in this area from third countries and should therefore demand particularly via the OECD that they too should apply minimum levels of taxation
We recognise that this cannot be expected immediately and must therefore agree with the amendment approved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy in favour of a % rather than a % minimum rate to less the impact of any harmful competition
We therefore disagree with the rapporteur who has just told us that he would be voting for the % figure
Alongside the Code of Conduct adopted by the Council in an effort to avoid harmful tax competition among Member States the Commission has presented a text in the form of a proposal for a directive that is both premature and immature
It is premature because it lacks a global approach towards tax harmonisation
Harmonisation of taxation of savings is just one specific aspect of a harmonisation operation that must encompass a number of other areas of which company taxation is one of the most important
Harmonising only one part of the tax system is potentially more harmful than maintaining the different fiscal regimes that currently exist
As a result the true merit of a directive on harmonising taxation of savings can only be appreciated once the overall plan has been drawn up and approved
The text is immature because all of its components are largely controversial and their effects on the European economy are not known
The European Commission and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy set out the principles on which agreement could be reached in time a withholding tax coexistence a common rate of withholding tax
But the practical application of these principles requires more careful consideration and above all solutions must first be found to many specific problems the definition of a realistic minimum rate of withholding tax coexistence yes but without the additional untransparent complications of a system of certificates and reimbursements paving the way for problems in the system imprecise definitions of the beneficial owner and the paying agent potentially negative consequences for the European financial markets if Eurobonds are included in this directive without exemption and so on
None of these problems has as yet been resolved and as a result this proposal for a directive can at the very most be considered as a preliminary draft that still requires intensive work
Some of Parliament amendments are a step in the right direction without necessarily touching on the fundamental problems the rate of the withholding tax has been lowered the role of certain neighbouring countries which will be the sole beneficiaries of the directive in its current version is mentioned the usefulness of a certain degree of fair tax competition and the subsequent beneficial reduction in fiscal pressure is underlined
Otherwise the report remains too close to the Commission text
Even though the explanatory statement is not part of the legislative text it contains several opinions with which I do not agree reducing the problem of Eurobonds to a purely British problem and above all the rapporteur ideal vision according to which an ideal fiscal regime should be based on the principle of supply of information to the fiscal authorities ie on the elimination of banking secrecy for fiscal purposes
For these reasons I am voting against the Pérez Royo report
I can support an effort being made to counter speculation due to the different rules on the taxation of interest on savings accounts in the EU Member States so as to ensure a modest minimum level of taxation
I can also support the Commission thinking as regards a minimum level of taxation but I would like to stress that this does not mean that the Danish Conservatives endorse an actual harmonisation of tax rates
I would also like to help bring about a certain exchange of information between Member States to make it possible for taxation to take place in one form or another
At the same time however we must ensure that new EU rules in this field do not encourage pension funds and other financial institutions currently based in the EU area to move to countries outside the European Union
It is not necessary to recall the origins of this proposal for a directive or the importance that the fiscal regime of interest assumes in the functioning of the single market especially when regarded in relation to the introduction of the euro
The first three lines of the rapporteur explanatory statement thus crudely reveal that the objective being pursued is to combat the pernicious yet entirely predictable effects of the creation of the euro on certain capital movements
As a result of the introduction of the euro in the single market the tax differentials between the various Member States are causing significant capital movements and attempts are now being made to curb these for example by introducing a minimum rate of taxation on income from capital invested by individuals
It is astonishing to note that the effects of the euro on capital movements were not properly understood before it was introduced
Regarding the report itself the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations has voted in favour of the amendments spelling out the need to harmonise the basic principles of taxation with OECD members
If we introduce harmonisation that is limited only to the Member States of the European Union it is highly probable that we will witness the flight of capital to third countries
With regard to the minimum rate of taxation of interest paid our group voted in favour of the amendment by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy which lowers this minimum rate to % from the % rate proposed by the Commission a minimum rate that is too high could result in the flight of capital to third countries
EMU and the euro demand the harmonisation of fiscal policy within the European Union and the shaping of a single taxation framework for economic activity in all Member States
This attempt at equalisation pays scant regard to the different growth levels of each country to the repercussions that a single tax policy will have on national budgets to growth and social expenditure and above all to the incomes of working people
Its aim is to increase hard-hitting tax measures at the expense of working people and to lighten the tax burden on businesses and capital markets thereby increasing their profits
The fiscal policy which is taking shape little by little within the European Union a typical example of which is the proposal to tax income from savings that we are debating today will strengthen even further regional and social inequalities
It will make big business even more unaccountable and strengthen the divisions in economic life
The Commission proposal favours tax havens of all kinds and the multifarious exemptions that exist in the system for taxing large corporations
It taxes the interest on the savings of the small investor and the small saver and eases the tax burden on companies and large conglomerates
This is happening at a time when in the name of social security funding or the reduction of public deficits proposals are being elaborated or ideas are being put forward to further increase the burden of indirect taxation which blights the lives of the ordinary person in the street and to further reduce the public social provision of health and pension cover because of the high costs involved
It is clear that those who rule the EU believe that the enormous profits and revenues which can legally avoid any form of tax burden through a series of exemptions and derogations which are provided for in national tax laws such as revenues from financial products cannot and what is more must not play a role in achieving these aims
The people and the workers will bear the costs and the profits will go to large companies and the capital markets
We regard as unacceptable and at the same time revealing of the intentions of the EU and EMU the fact that the proposed directive only covers physical persons when we know that the vast majority of those entitled to hold foreign accounts or cross-border bonds government or not are the large institutional investors
Indeed it is extremely telling that the amendments which called for the directive to be extended to cover legal entities were rejected
It is incomprehensible to us that taxes should be instituted which exempt companies
Such a regulation is a harsh blow to employment and growth as it encourages capital to be kept in banks or to be converted into bonds or other financial products rather than into investments in production
This is not taxation Working people are being penalised for doing their utmost to save money
This regulation is simply paving the way for the corruption of economic life the exploitation of working people and the creation of brass-plate companies which are set up solely to avoid taxation
It is also creating the conditions and this is made easier by the convergence of interest rates to transfer accounts to a country other than the country of residence or to strengthen the cross-border market in bonds at the expense of the domestic market
The aim is to circumvent tax legislation for residents and to avoid paying tax
In particular this regulation makes it easier to use zero coupon bonds as a way of laundering money as they can be sold before their due date to people who are not covered by the directive and are therefore not subject to tax
The proposal for a directive that we are examining is part of a package adopted by the Council in December and we wish to reiterate that we wholly disagree with the logic of packages which aim to ward off any genuine objections which may arise and to allow decisions to be made which hurt the weakest countries
This is exactly what is happening with the proposal for a directive to tax the interest earned by affiliated companies which directly hurts Greece as it is an importer of capital
Taking advantage of the opportunity provided by the relevant forecast in the draft directive and bearing in mind that the start of a new round of multilateral negotiations is approaching we urge the Commission and the Council to take the necessary actions to institute at international level a means of ensuring that interest on bank deposits and revenues from bonds of all kinds and other financial products are taxed
Such actions must be targeted at large international institutional investors and more generally at legal entities
A way must also be found to tax all kinds of cross-border capital movements which are carried out for profit in order to put a brake albeit in a limited way on the increase in the volume of parasitic speculative capital
Lehne report A
In our view the opinion delivered by the European Parliament on this subject is the result of a compromise which is preventing Parliament from helping to advance the Commission continuing work in this area
Unfortunately the opinion is representative of the fact that the right particularly the PPE Group is working to ensure that Parliament becomes an obstacle to third-country nationals enjoying the rights to which they are entitled while in the European Union
A common set of rules defining the rights of third-country nationals and their freedom to travel and reside in the Member States is a precondition for all citizens being able to move around freely
In this context it is regrettable that the PPE Group and others are trying to restrict these rights and opportunities
Not only is it detrimental to the rights and opportunities of a number of third-country nationals but it also makes it more difficult to achieve the goal of the free movement of persons
We should like to make it clear that we are opposed to the ranking of people seeking work in a Member State in the following order citizens of the Member State itself citizens of the Union and third-country nationals as set out in Article 
Nor are we able to agree with the view expressed in Amendment No tabled by Mr Nassauer of the PPE Group in which he calls for the age limit for family reunification to be lowered to 
However we welcome Amendments Nos and which place partnerships on an equal footing with marriage in terms of family reunification although we are concerned that the wording of these amendments to EU rules detracts from the possibility of them being applied effectively in all the Member States
It is essential to point out at this stage that asylum seekers are covered by existing conventions aimed at protecting them against persecution
Different criteria must be applied to those wishing to enter the European Union on economic grounds
The key issue now under debate is whether we should have a strict or a relaxed admission policy
I would argue that if the European Union admits third country nationals for the purpose of servicing the specific needs of individual Member States labour shortages then it would be repulsive to adopt a revolving door policy by taking no responsibility for the tangible economic input of workers from third countries
I would further argue for a strict rather than a relaxed admission policy so as to protect the rights of third country nationals by outlining clearly the necessary criteria for admission
Harmonising Member States visa policies with regard to third countries is in my view essential as a major step towards improving the safety of travel documents
The mutual recognition of travel documents is paramount to implementing EU policy on the admission of third country nationals
From an Irish perspective the influx of refugees asylum seekers and immigrants is a relatively new experience for us as a nation
Mistakes have been made in dealing with this evolving problem by successive governments
I have to say I am angry at how some of our citizens treat these strangers
We can at times hide behind the provisions of the Dublin Convention which states that the first EU country that an asylum seeker enters must process their application for asylum
Ireland is seldom the first port of call for prospective asylum seekers
The Irish Government should be bold and courageous enough to bring in an amnesty for existing refugees and asylum seekers in Ireland
It should then introduce new and uniform rules to deal with new applications in the future
The Irish people must show some compassion on this issue
We more than most nations have benefited from the generosity of spirit and kindness of other nations in our history most notably Britain Australia and the United States of America
The very fact that Ireland is currently experiencing an unprecedented economic boom must mean that we do not forget our humanitarian duty to others
Immigration in Europe is one of the areas which we have dealt with least during the present parliamentary term and as a result the work done in this area is largely superficial
However the Amsterdam Treaty which is to be implemented in the near future obliges us to broadly review the current status quo with a view to implementing new immigration measures
All this will very probably lead to numerous problems in view of the current inflow of persons and the inability of the European Union to become an outlet for world poverty
One of the major difficulties will consist in making the distinction between foreign nationals who have already been resident in the European Union for several years and those who have just arrived
Hence the importance of new provisions in the Amsterdam Treaty which differentiate with a considerable degree of humanity between short-term and long-term residence and immigration and temporary asylum policy
In the face of the numerous political conflicts currently taking place throughout the world including on our continent we cannot close our eyes and just turn away asylum seekers saying that they are not our concern
Significant progress has been made with regard to the idea of collective responsibility of a group of nations
European legislation must therefore act as a very strict barrier to foreseeable inflows of persons
The same applies to economic immigration the criteria for which must be laid down very clearly
The European Parliament has always ardently defended very strict international rules that can be applied in practice
Controlling our migratory inflows is becoming a major issue particularly on the eve of enlargement when a number of third country nationals will soon become full citizens
I therefore approve the second Lehne report because it takes into consideration the realities of the world today without being too liberal and causing harm to our own nationals but leaving the door open to integration that is controlled in terms of the number of immigrants and in terms of time
The European Parliament needs to find the right balance
Immigration must not constitute an obstacle to European cooperation programmes but for all that we cannot refuse positive immigration nor can we reject agreements with third countries
Today the Danish Social Democrats voted in favour of a report concerning uniform rules for the admission of third-country nationals to the Member States
In Denmark there has been a halt on immigration since 
We have some very tough rules on immigration for the purpose of paid employment
Age patterns in the Member States and a general upturn in the economy mean that we are going to have a shortage of labour in some sectors in the near future
We may therefore be forced to consider how persistently this halt on immigration should be maintained
Lehne report A
Requiring people to have visas creates a number of awkward problems for third-country nationals wishing to travel and reside in the Member States
As regards common rules for granting visas we think there are two aspects to be borne in mind On the one hand the rules should make it possible for everyone residing within the Union to move around and on the other they should be applied in a spirit of generosity that will enable third-country nationals to travel and reside so far as is practicable in the Member States
We do not foresee any conflict between these two aspects
In this respect we welcome the committee draft report since it emphasises the need for more latitude in the rules relating to visas
The draft Convention on rules for the admission of third-country nationals to the Member States of the Union is quite obviously responding to a need to try to introduce minimum conditions for the crossing of EU external borders in order to avoid wide gaps allowing immigrants to enter a Member State and then move throughout the whole of Europe
However this text which has clearly been carefully negotiated by the Council has been damaged by the European Parliament amendments
At any rate it is affected by a structural defect which calls for serious reservations on our part possible revision would be practically out of the question
In fact Article provides that the Council shall unanimously decide on any amendments to the Convention which might seem logical given that the text will have been adopted unanimously
However this provision poses a problem because if unanimity governs the adoption of a text it ends up being ultraconservative and even intransigent when it comes to its revision
In fact the proper rule which should be laid down is that when a text has been adopted unanimously the failure of one Member State to give its support by requesting that it be revised must automatically lead to improvements being made to it
This is not a hypothetical question
It is currently being raised in France in relation to the directive on the conservation of wild birds
It could be raised tomorrow in relation to the Convention on rules for the admission of third-country nationals for example if a signatory country requests amendments to the rules on family reunification
Nor is there anything extraordinary about this question no text can remain unchanged forever and it is normal to provide the means to make changes to it in the future
Moreover an additional problem arises in the Convention we are dealing with today if a country which had not managed to successfully renegotiate a text wanted to be withdrawn by democratic means from part of or all of the text it would be difficult to see how this would be possible when as provided for by the Amsterdam Treaty it would not have the right to re-establish unilaterally certain checks at its internal borders
We may therefore find it quite strange that governments are pursuing such conventions without having resolved problems as serious as these beforehand and without having taken all the necessary precautions
Demands relating to the desire to harmonise immigration and visa policies are also made in Mr Lehne report
The rapporteur original idea like that of Mrs Lindeperg whose report results from the same logic despite the fact that they belong to different political groups is that in view of the present difficulties in these areas the policies can no longer be dealt with at national level alone
The draft Amsterdam Treaty should therefore allow the simultaneous harmonisation of visa policies without which the free movement of persons implementation of a fair asylum policy harmonisation of immigration rules action to combat illegal immigration and effective checks at the external borders would be jeopardised
The report has undoubtedly been produced within the context of the ratification of the draft Amsterdam Treaty
It establishes a provisional regulation the Commission having already undertaken to submit a fresh proposal in the form of a directive as soon as the amendments agreed in the Amsterdam Treaty enter into force
However in the explanatory statement of the proposal for a Council Act the Commission considers that current economic factors and the situation on the labour market make it impossible to do away with selective admission policies formulated by the Member States for the purposes of paid employment or independent economic activity
Nevertheless it persists in believing that it is Europe duty to adopt a global approach with regard to immigration policies
What about the problems experienced by immigrant populations integrating into societies which already have difficulty defining structures for human and social relations both internally and with other societies
What about the economic and social cost of such measures
What about the checks I mentioned at the Community external borders which we know do not actually exist or are ineffective in certain regions
How much flexibility will the Member States have to react to special situations in view of a safeguard clause providing for an exception whose duration is limited to what is strictly necessary and taking into account the interests of other Member States which the state keeps closely informed as well as the Commission
All these questions remain unanswered today
Too much is at stake for us to venture into the unknown in this way
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
This maxim is too easily applied to the spirit of Mr Lehne reports
Politics is the art of reality not of utopia
The generations of this century have been paying too high a price for this since for us to transform the European Union of tomorrow into a vast Yugoslavia in the name of false generosity
The Amsterdam Treaty and Schengen both give the EU greater discretion as regards immigration visas and asylum and the report is an extension of this policy
However the committee is of the opinion that the report does not go far enough in respect of the harmonisation of visa requirements in the individual Member States
The existence of common rules for visas makes the European Union more like a state
For a number of countries it also means that some third-country nationals would have to apply for visas to enter the Union
There is also a strong possibility that such a policy would serve to reinforce the external borders and encourage an inflexible approach to refugees and immigrants
Consequently I have voted against the report
Lindeperg report A
Madam President in the Lindeperg report which has just been voted on the European Parliament calls for the upwards harmonisation these are the words used in the explanatory statement of forms of protection complementary to refugee status
In fact the Geneva Convention of July signed by all the Member States of the Union provides for this status to be granted to individuals persecuted in their country of origin on grounds of race religion nationality membership of a social group or political opinion the European Parliament thinks this is too restrictive
In particular it would like a broader definition of the recognised causes of persecution to include gender-specific causes for example and of potential persecutors whose definition would no longer be confined to state bodies
In addition to a less restrictive interpretation of the definitions of the Geneva Convention which would open up the way for a complementary refugee status a temporary protection scheme for displaced persons is being set up at the same time by the European Union in order to offer a full range of legal structures for reception to all individuals or groups of persons wanting to flee their country of origin for one reason or another
The proposal which the European Parliament is making with regard to this complementary status seems to me to be completely typical of how it usually acts
It is announced that the new status will grant rights without taking the trouble to say which ones and merely giving the impression that they will not be subject to a time-limit
No attempt is made to ascertain how many new refugees there will be as a result directly or indirectly nor how much all of this will cost the taxpayer
Of course there is no mention anywhere in the report of what the citizens of the Member States might think about this
For our part we consider that this is a completely irresponsible way of doing things
Of course the countries of Europe must show concern for the welfare of foreigners who have been persecuted firstly by scrupulously applying the provisions of the Geneva Convention
However this solicitude can take very different forms one of which being residence on our territories for an unlimited duration which we would have to reject more or less outright
Madam President I am making this explanation of vote not only on my own behalf but also on behalf of the Spanish delegation in the Group of the European People Party
We abstained in the vote on this report and I think that I should give you an explanation as to why we neither voted in favour or against This is particularly important since an issue such as this is perhaps one that requires us to take a particular stance which is what the Spanish delegation in the PPE Group is doing
We are naturally in favour of harmonising complementary forms of protection so that refugees who do not meet the conditions laid down in the Geneva Convention yet who truly deserve protection will receive it
That is why we have not voted against the report
We agree with the rapporteur and the majority of this House about the objectives involved
However we did not vote in favour of the report because it contains serious flaws In addition to its legal shortcomings it also tries to force an interpretation of the Geneva Convention on us which is totally contrary to international law
However it was essentially political reasons that prevented us from voting in favour of the report the demagogy it uses only serves to harm the interests it aims to protect
This therefore explains the constructive abstention of the Spanish delegation in the PPE Group
We should like to thank the rapporteur for his very thorough work on an urgently needed report
We think there is good reason to focus attention on the serious deficiencies that exist in the Union reception procedure for asylum-seekers
The report deserves praise for the way in which it discusses the measures that will be required to create a workable common refugee policy in which compassion solidarity and generosity play a major role in determining the Member States responsibility for accepting refugees
With regard to the amendment tabled by the GUENGL Group relating to Abdullah Ocalan we do not believe that the matter really comes within the ambit of the present discussion
Unfortunately we note from the amendment tabled by the rightist UPE and PPE Groups that the difficulties which the Council had in reaching agreement on a common refugee policy are also reflected in the narrow attitude displayed by these groups in the European Parliament
The way in which this matter has been handled shows yet again the ideological divide that exists between the right and left in Europe in their approach to a humane and generous refugee policy
We regret that the same ideological differences have served to deprive Amendments Nos and relating to persecution on the grounds of sexual proclivity of the support they warranted from the European Parliament
Today the Danish Social Democrats voted in favour of a report on the need to adopt common rules in addition to the Geneva Convention
There is a need for European cooperation on refugee questions
The first step towards a common refugee policy was taken with the adoption of the Geneva Convention
The next step should be some common rules for people who are not covered by the latter
These are people who are not being persecuted individually by the State for political reasons but who need asylum on other humanitarian grounds
The Member States should have a uniform interpretation of how these people can be assured of proper protection
It is time for us to start discussing a common definition of de facto and other humanitarian protection
There should be certain minimum standards with which all the Member States are obliged to comply
Since the start of the s the European Union has been experiencing an influx of refugees who have fled their countries of origin for various reasons
Many of them do not fall into the category of refugees as defined by the Geneva Convention
However the European Union cannot refuse these persons entry into its territory
In fact sending them back to their country of origin without further ado would put their lives at risk or would at the very least jeopardise their moral or physical integrity
Harmonisation of the policies pursued by the Member States is necessary in this area and this will be possible as soon as the Amsterdam Treaty has entered into force
Within this framework we need to set up an instrument to harmonise the forms of protection complementing refugee status
I broadly agree with the rapporteur on all these points
In fact I believe as she does that the European Union must grant a specific status to persons who cannot claim refugee status within the meaning of the Geneva Convention
The debate is mainly concerned with the definition of the categories which are eligible for this complementary status
It seems to me that a number of points still need to be clarified
One example will illustrate my view whatever we think otherwise of the death penalty can a person who at the end of a fair trial is sentenced to death for crimes and offences under civil law having exhausted all the possibilities of legal redress really enjoy the specific status I mentioned as the rapporteur seems to suggest under the pretext that capital punishment has been abolished by the Member States of the European Union
If so on what terms
Can a condemned person be given the same status as for example a woman fleeing her country of origin because she has fears of being subjected to sexual violence or inhuman or degrading treatment
This type of question is at the very least worth taking time to discuss in depth
Complementary status is essential
I just think that the dossier is not ready yet
I am therefore voting against this report and urge that the debate be continued
The June Movement is going to vote for the Lindeperg report to show our willingness to accept refugees
The Lindeperg report is more humane than the policy which the civil servants and justice ministers are planning
But for the record we should not forget to point out that it should be for the Member States themselves to decide on immigration and refugee policy
We do not want any supranational cooperation in this area because refugee policy is improved if the people have the opportunity to endorse it
In the main this is a balanced document which addresses some very important fundamental issues
I sincerely hope that the amendments tabled by the Conservative groups are not adopted
They would only detract from the quality of the report as the aim of those political groups is not to make life easier for refugees and asylum-seekers
Consequently I hope that Amendments Nos and relating to homosexuals tabled by the ARE Group are adopted by the House
The matter should be taken very seriously since homosexuals are persecuted in many countries
Some countries mete out a range of punishments including the death penalty for a person sexual predilections
Freedom from persecution or harassment because of one sexual predilections is a basic human right
It is essential that this should be taken into account in the discussions on asylum legislation as well as with regard to protection for homosexuals
I cannot endorse the Lindeperg report because I do not think that asylum policy should be a matter for the EU
In my opinion this belongs solely at national level
Of course individual countries are morally and politically obliged to comply with whatever international conventions there may be in this field both in letter and in spirit
The rich democracies in particular are obliged to take a lead where the protection of the persecuted people of the world is concerned which includes providing asylum themselves for those who are being persecuted
However my rejection of the report on grounds of political principle should not overshadow the fact that Mrs Lindeperg clearly deals with an important matter in a proper and humane way
An example is her highlighting of the problem that there are people today who in reality are refugees but who are not recognised as such according to the definition of the term contained in the Geneva Convention
I would like to point out however that it would be a grave mistake for the EU to set about creating an alternative definition of refugees
That would be contrary to the principle that refugees are protected by an international convention agreed under international auspices
At the same time I could well imagine that an EU agreement on a different definition of refugees would not be seen as an addition to the Geneva Convention but as a step towards depriving the Geneva Convention of its substance so that many more people could be turned away with a clear conscience at the EU external borders
The general impression of the EU and not least of its Member States is not that they want to expand the definition of refugees but on the contrary that they wish to restrict it
The Danish Prime Minister said before the Danish referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty that a yes to the Amsterdam Treaty will mean fewer refugees in Denmark
The report by our colleague Mrs Lindeperg totally misses the main point of the asylum seeker problem in the European Union which is that we are not in fact facing a real asylum problem at all but an asylum cheating problem
That is something totally different
Everybody knows that just a few percent of asylum seekers in Europe can justifiably invoke the recognised international conventions on asylum
If the hundreds of thousands of asylum cheaters who arrive every year to benefit from social security in our Member States were systematically and effectively sent back over the borders then there would be no asylum problem at all in Europe
You may be shocked by the use of the term asylum cheater
Yet it has the benefit of clarity highlights a reality and contains no human condemnation
There are only two possible approaches here either you play at being Santa Claus and say all foreigners are welcome in Europe and can be supported by us or you must apply the existing agreements to the letter in which the case the asylum cheaters must be sent back to their own countries not just because they put the whole asylum system at risk and thus harm genuine asylum seekers but also because in Europe itself there are many poor and underprivileged to whom we first owe an obligation before we can take all the suffering of the world on our shoulders
Mrs Lindeperg clearly opts for the Santa Claus policy
But she is playing Santa Claus at the taxpayers expense
If her proposals for a further undermining of asylum regulations were to become a reality the final barrier would be down and we would risk being swamped by fortune seekers from all over the world
This is therefore an irresponsible report yet another to come before Parliament that we will not be approving
The sitting was suspended at pm and resumed at pm
Progress on Agenda 
The next item is the statement by the Council on progress on Agenda 
I give the floor to the President-in-Office of the Council
Mr President ladies and gentlemen when Mr Fischer presented the programme of the German Presidency here approximately a month ago in his capacity of President-in-Office of the Council the first priority he listed for this six-month term was the successful conclusion of the Agenda negotiations by the time of the special European Council meeting on and March
It is now just six weeks to the day until this meeting which will be held in Berlin at the request of Chancellor Schröder
The negotiations on the individual components of the Agenda which we have been conducting intensively since the Commission submitted its legislative proposals eleven months ago and at full stretch since the beginning of the year have now reached a crucial phase
I am glad that at this stage I can now discuss Agenda with you in detail
Let me start with a brief outline of the timetable up to the special summit
By the time of the General Affairs Council and Agriculture Council in just under a fortnight time we will have had a first run-through of all the major components of the global compromise to be reached by the Council bodies and Councils
This first consideration of the key questions under the aegis of the General Affairs Council the Economic and Financial Affairs Council and the Agriculture Council has already proved fairly successful in terms of reaching compromises and consensus on some aspects
But it also became clear that we still have an enormous way to go and very little time to do so
The Heads of State and Government will assess the progress made to date especially the results we hope to see from the Agriculture Council on and February at their informal summit in Bonn on February
We expect this meeting to which Chancellor Schröder has also invited the President of the European Parliament to provide important guidelines for the further activities of the final phase
Immediately after the Bonn summit we will after all have to start tying up the package that the Heads of State and Government are to finish negotiating on and bring to a political conclusion at the end of March and during April under the responsibility of the General Affairs Council as the coordinating body
For the rest you could regard the fact that Chancellor Schröder has moved the special summit from Brussels to Bonn as a sign of our strong commitment to bringing the negotiations to a successful conclusion
The German Presidency will do its utmost to achieve that successful conclusion
We have become convinced that other Member States are also firmly resolved to achieve it and therefore want to conduct the negotiations in a constructive and positive manner
Everybody realises that a balanced package is the only solution and that there can be no winners or losers
Each Member State must have its appropriate say on the final result but at the same time each must make its contribution to achieving that result
Everything must be laid out openly on the table There can be no taboo subjects
It is of paramount importance to the Union and thus to all the Member States and all the partner states realise this for us to be able to declare the European Union the winner at the end of March for one thing is sure Europe could very easily become the loser
Putting it off will not make the solution any easier on the contrary
If a few months after the entry into force of monetary union and indeed only a few weeks before the June elections to the European Parliament we disappointed people hopes that we would prove capable of action the consequences would be very serious
If the European Union which since the beginning of this year has become a new financial market with global influence and global responsibility cannot also resolutely assume the corresponding political responsibility on the basis also of the Amsterdam Treaty then too Europe would be the loser
And if the momentum of the enlargement negotiations is weakened and the date of their conclusion is postponed the effects would be so damaging as to set us back in our work for a long time
I hope these and other arguments will prompt all the Member States to make more and even greater concerted efforts
Meanwhile it is generally realised that unlike the case of the earlier Delors I and Delors II packages this time it will not be possible to reach a compromise in the end by making extra funds available
On the contrary the unequal burden-sharing that resulted from this kind of approach in earlier cases must be corrected this time for the sake of the legitimacy and future viability of the European Union
I do not think any of our partners questions the principle of fair burden-sharing just as they cannot question the principle of solidarity which is the constitutive principle of the European Union
One basic condition for the success of the negotiations as a whole is that the Heads of State and Government decided in Vienna to include all the components of the Agenda in the discussion and only to seek a solution in the form of an overall package
Everything is laid out on the table
That means a balance can be found covering every aspect and the combination of various parameters ensures that the further negotiations will be sufficiently flexible and dynamic
In many areas of the Agenda it has proved possible to broaden the basis of agreement over the past weeks
This applies in particular to the reform of the Structural Funds where consensus has now been reached on major issues
I am thinking for instance of the reduction of the number of objectives from seven to three the reduction of the number of Community initiatives and the long-disputed question of coherence between national aid and EU aid I am also thinking of the efficiency performance reserve where gratifying progress was made at the last General Affairs Council
On other important questions such as strict adherence to the % criterion for Objective areas and reserving some two thirds of funds for Objective the discussions have already produced clear majorities
Here you must not forget that under the Austrian Presidency broad political agreement was already reached on the pre-accession instruments that are so important to enlargement policy
The same applies to the financial regulation on trans-European networks
In both areas structural reform and pre-accession instruments I held talks yesterday with European Parliament representatives under the informal consultation procedure continuing those that were begun under the Austrian Presidency
We attach the utmost importance to this dialogue at political level as a means of concluding the Agenda successfully and on schedule
In the coming weeks we will therefore carry on with this dialogue intensively and in a constructive spirit
Mr Fischer gave another assurance to that effect in his reply to the letter from your President Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado
Dialogue is not a one-way street
The Council will take account in its decision-making of the positions expressed by the European Parliament during these discussions
The informal consultation forms part of our endeavour to provide Parliament with comprehensive information at all times as reflected in our debate today and our offer to hold an exchange of views on Agenda at any time in an informal political trialogue
We are well aware that not only the Council but especially you the Members of the European Parliament will have an important part to play in resolving the Agenda-related problems in good time
Our presidency will do all it can to cooperate closely with you on a basis of trust
Applause
I do not need to remind the President-in-Office of how essential it is to meet the timetable not only to secure the necessary democratic legitimacy for the Agenda package but also to allow programmes and policies to be implemented in a timely and effective manner
We welcome his efforts in this respect
We however need to make progress on our priorities
Parliament priorities on the general framework regulation are in fact clear
As regards the modified proposal on the efficiency performance reserve Parliament must be involved in decisions on the mid-term review and the reallocation of the national reserve
What role for Parliament can the presidency and the Council envisage to guarantee effective parliamentary scrutiny of the reserve mechanism
Thirty-four pages of guidelines have been produced by the Commission for the operation of regional programmes
How will these relate to the regulations
How will they be discussed in the Council
The guidelines underline the vital role of urban areas in the European economy
Will the presidency demonstrate its commitment to urban areas by arguing in favour of Parliament priority requiring continuation of the URBAN Community initiative
The Commission reform proposal does not contain any contingency plans for unexpected economic and social restructuring in the regions
Does the presidency agree that it would be wise to set aside some resources under a special Community initiative for unexpected crises to enable the Union to act in such situations
Likewise is the presidency prepared to promote this priority in the Council
Finally partnership is a key priority for Parliament in ensuring that the Europe we build and its policies are genuinely inclusive supporting a People Europe
For this reason we want a strong partnership pact in both designing drafting and implementing the new generation of programmes
Will the presidency back Parliament demands in the Council for a strengthened partnership pact and what concrete and practical actions will the presidency take to ensure that partnership is not just an optional extra but an integral component of all programmes strengthening the cohesion of a People Europe
Mr President having just listened to the presentation by the Council we cannot immediately say that it has provided a great deal of information
We are in fact very much interested in the Council own activities concerning enlargement and in particular how the Council views the state of progress in the negotiations
Is it the case as we often read at present and also hear from the various think tanks that we are already thinking about discussing accession dates for certain countries
There are certain reports to this effect and there is a great deal of optimism and we have also heard the Foreign Ministers of certain Member States say that it is time to set accession dates
It has always been the case with the enlargement strategy that both the Commission and the negotiators have said that this would be the wrong approach that the accession date is a matter for the country itself and not the Commission or the European institutions as such
The countries themselves must satisfy the rules and conditions for membership and it is our job to encourage progress
It has always been said that setting dates for certain countries would be an encouragement for them to be rather less energetic in their efforts as it would be seen as a kind of guarantee of membership
Is there any reason to review that position and now to say it is better to set dates after all
What would be the reason for this
Do you see any virtue in this
Secondly we are seeing that public opinion is changing and this is affecting the negotiations
In some applicant countries public opinion is becoming progressively less positive towards membership of the European Union
It is perhaps also true that in many cases there is a serious lack of knowledge about the Union as also in the Member States at present
Is there not good cause for the Council too to encourage a drastic improvement in information on the European Union in the applicant countries
Mr President first of all I should like to express my appreciation to the German Presidency for taking the trouble to come here this afternoon in order to explain how far negotiations have progressed
I am pleased that Mr Verheugen has said that everything is on the table during these negotiations
I should like to stress that fair burden-sharing is one of the important points in this whole negotiating process and I believe that this must not be ignored when we talk about support for Europe
Over recent weeks Parliament has voted on the main points of Agenda 
We voted on structural policy and on agricultural policy
If my calculations are correct we are planning to spend considerably more than what I read at present in newspaper reports on the Agenda negotiations
I believe there is a danger here that we will not reach agreement on the financial perspectives
If my knowledge of the rules is correct votes are needed and when I saw the voting pattern on the main points here in Parliament we seemed to be very divided
I would also warn against assuming in advance that if there is agreement in the Council on drastic spending cuts Parliament will automatically approve them
I fear this is not so
We would then fall back on Article which would mean that we would be spending considerably more than the Finance Ministers generally want to see or consider desirable in relation to the launch of the euro and so on
I am a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and I should also like to say something about agriculture
I would warn against the general view that everything spent on agriculture is a waste of money
I am not just saying this because of this morning demonstration here in Strasbourg
Too often I hear that half of the European budget goes to % of the population and so on
I believe we must see this in relation to all tax revenue
When I look at the tax burden in Europe approximately % of the gross national product my calculations tell me that approximately % goes to % of the population
That is certainly not excessive
We must of course always ensure that money is not wasted
We must have no more surpluses and keep production within limits
But we need to keep agricultural management in Europe basically as it is and I think the German Presidency would do well to try to achieve this
Mr President-in-Office you have just said that there would be neither winners nor losers in the general agreement that you hope to develop between now and the Berlin summit
We saw today that there were many French and German tractors in Strasbourg
If my information is correct there will also be many tractors on February in Brussels and these will come from all over the European Union
We understand the farmers concerns
The common agricultural policy is the European Union main common policy
They are worried because they cannot subscribe to the Commission proposals
Moreover I am very surprised that Mr Fischler is not on the Commission bench while two other Commissioners concerned with the Agenda package are present
The Commission proposals are going to bring a drop in prices that will not be fully compensated but if my information is correct the Council would favour more moderate reductions in prices but with a reduction in compensatory aid
I would therefore like you to explain how when agricultural revenue fell by almost % throughout the European Union in you will ensure that there are no losers among farmers when the final package is presented
I would like to know what the Council current thoughts are on this matter
Mr President I should like to begin by saying that we obviously all agree that reaching agreement on such an important matter as this should not be put off indefinitely
But I would also say that a good agreement is better than agreement at any price we should not seek just any agreement but rather a good one especially since it will remain in force for seven years
I must also refer to an underlying problem in this area both in the original Commission proposal and in the proposals that have been discussed in the Council we have noted the same thing a lowering of own resources from % to % in the case of the Commission proposal entirely to the detriment of the structural funds and actions
How can that be acceptable
I should therefore like to ask the Council how it can reconcile this situation with the fundamental principle of economic and social cohesion enshrined in the Treaties
And what can you tell us about own resources Mr President-in-Office
Mr President I welcome the President-in-Office here this afternoon
Could he tell us firstly what pressure he is under from the Finance Ministers to bring about a deal within the financial limits they require
Will he be able in the longer term to bring about a deal under which the European Union will be able to finance the extra support that is required because of the cuts in prices
Is it not time to face up to reality and accept that this reform as proposed will not work
It will be more expensive to the budget and the consumer will not get any benefit
The processors and the retailers will eat it all up
We saw the demonstration here today and know that agriculture throughout Europe is in a serious state
My problem is that when I go back to my farmers and tell them of % cuts in beef and % cuts in milk they do not understand
Nor do they want to understand it
The most recent statistics indicate a % fall in income in my region during This is on top of other serious falls in and 
Turning to the regional aspect I understand that yesterday in Bonn the President-in-Office met my party leader David Trimble First Minister Designate from the Northern Ireland Assembly
I understand that during that time you had discussions with him on support for Northern Ireland under Objective and our position in the future
As you will know politics in Northern Ireland is at a very delicate stage at this moment in time
Could you tell us if you were able to reassure him that the Council will be supportive to Northern Ireland in the future
The fact remains that if the Republic of Ireland and border counties achieve Objective status and Northern Ireland does not that will be unacceptable
Mr President the meeting of the ECOFIN Council of February marked the collapse of negotiations on Agenda 
A joint text setting out the financial framework is vital to enable finance ministers to allow their opposite numbers in the agriculture ministries to implement the long-debated reform of the common agricultural policy but there was no consensus
The German minister Mr Lafontaine went too far and instead of confining himself to the subject of agricultural spending structural spending and own resources sought to widen the debate
The result was disagreement and in effect a decision to stabilise spending for the period
The countries in favour of freezing agricultural spending lined up with the position of the German Presidency leaving the question of the CAP worryingly unresolved while outside the Chamber the farmers anger is becoming a genuine cause for concern especially as the next few days will see demonstrators from all over Europe joining those who are here today
Mr President Mr President-in-Office I would like to ask four specific questions
Firstly are you working on the basis of the Commission proposal or on the information provided by the Austrian Presidency
Secondly given that the Union main objectives are to strengthen the euro and create employment what resources are being set aside for these in the financial perspective
Thirdly as regards the fair distribution of payments how are you going to remedy the fact that under the agricultural policy % of farmers receive %of the funds
And finally as regards enlargement do you plan to divide up the budget in the areas of agriculture and the Structural Funds in particular and if enlargement does not fit in with the Cohesion Fund to separate regional funding too
Mr President I too have noticed that there has been a delay in negotiations in the Council
If you were to continue at this rate Mr President-in-Office and I do not want to level criticism at you personally or at the German Presidency you are not going to be able to stick to the timetable that you yourself have set
It is clear that unlike the Council the European Parliament after painstaking debate has been able to adopt coherent positions on the issues arising under Agenda 
Back in November last year Parliament set out its priorities regarding the general framework regulation
Perhaps I may be allowed to mention a few of them
Firstly we said that % of Community GDP should be made available for structural actions
I understand the pressure that is exerted by public opinion in the richer Member States However we must not forget that the EU budget despite all the ambitious targets it sets is currently equivalent to that of Spain
Secondly we said that exactly and not approximately two thirds of Objective resources should be made available and that we must stick to the criteria defined by the Commission for including regions under Objective one of which states that only those regions with a per capita GDP which is less than % of Community GDP can be included
Thirdly we said that priority status should be given to Interreg and that there should be a special part relating to cooperation with islands and among island regions
Fourthly we opposed the efficiency performance reserve as originally proposed by the Commission
Proposals for a smaller reserve of % with national top-ups are a move in the right direction
I also want to make two points in connection with the Cohesion Fund
Firstly Mr President-in-Office I think that we must respect the Treaty which provides that Member States with less than % of Community GDP must participate in the Cohesion Fund
Secondly I would like you to tell me to what extent the positions of Parliament will be taken into consideration as it is obvious that the European Parliament is not prepared to budge from these positions
Of course we will discuss and negotiate but we cannot adopt stances which are completely out of line with these priorities
Mr President Mr President-in-Office I do not know if the Presidency-in-Office is fully aware of the fact that large sectors of European public opinion currently think of Agenda as a threat rather than as a necessity or an opportunity
Nor do I know if the Presidency-in-Office is aware that this is largely due to the way in which Austria and now Germany are approaching this issue
In my view they are putting an overly unilateral slant on the work and giving too much consideration to the pressure of public opinion within their own countries rather than taking an overall view of the European Union as they should do
Clearly the basic problem in my view lies in the fact that the ceiling for own resources is insufficient
However it is also true of course that the debate has concentrated on expenditure and forgotten about revenue
There is no doubt that we need an agreement that not only guarantees but also develops the principle of social and economic cohesion together with the relevant instruments
We also need to have a proper debate not so much on how to reduce those instruments but on how to increase the contributions from all the Member States fairly
For example what is the Presidency view of the proposal to include the criterion of relative prosperity in the chapter on revenue
Does the Presidency agree with the French proposal for some form of aggressive measures for the Cohesion Fund which to my mind would be unacceptable
Mr President I have two questions for the Council
The first concerns the pre-accession aids
Pre-accession aids are to be coordinated in the PHARE committee without as it seems now the presence of the applicant countries themselves
To what extent can this kind of pre-accession strategy be described as being based on partnership
My second question to the Council concerns the regional Structural Fund component in the EU
How much importance does the Council assign to the principles of partnership in the Structural Fund regulation especially the participation of the environmental partners the participation of the environmental NGOs the participation of representatives of equal opportunities for women and of the social partners
Mr President-in-Office we discovered yesterday evening that we agree to a very wide extent on the pre-accession funds
Even though the Austrian Presidency already achieved a consensus that is to say a consensus was already reached during the Austrian Presidency I do of course have to ask again how far you can still take Parliament decisions into consideration
We saw positive steps in that direction yesterday but I believe you should clarify once again whether there is in fact still any chance of movement here
Let me also say a few words on the Structural Funds
The current debate that centres on the need to stabilise expenditure and ensure fair burden-sharing is certainly right but we in the European Union have another task before us which must always be given due consideration it is the question of job creation
Here I will take up the cudgels for the Structural Funds and for maintaining these policies as far as possible
Structural aid is targeted at forward-looking development models and economic sectors which have the potential to create new employment opportunities
Is the Council aware that we must set this as a priority
Fighting unemployment and creating jobs is in fact the top priority and this is reflected in Agenda too where it is very strongly emphasised
Mr President Mr President-in-Office Commissioners the President-in-Office said that the choice of Berlin as the seat of the European Council is a symbol of how important the Presidency believes it is to bring Agenda to a conclusion in time to allow this Parliament to complete its legislative procedures before the European elections
He pointed out that the final agreement should not have any winners or losers and that Europe must be the only winner
We agree with that
But he also said that at this stage there will be no additional budgetary resources and he stressed in particular that the budgetary burden should be more fairly distributed
Up to now Mr President-in-Office none of the proposals that the Presidency has put forward in the Community institutions be they in official documents or in non-papers appear to look for a compromise to ensure that this burden is fairly distributed between all those involved Instead they only appear to consider the decision to reduce Community expenditure which is beyond any logical justification
With all due respect you are planning a reduction in agricultural expenditure of almost EUR million almost EUR m per year and a reduction in Category expenditure of EUR m almost EUR m per year without any justification in the light of Commission reports on cohesion This does not seem to reflect a compromise that has no winners or losers
I would therefore like to ask the German Presidency the following question when is the Presidency going to put forward truly balanced proposals for a compromise in which all the Member States will participate with each country naturally prepared to make allowances that might enable us to reach an agreement when necessary
Up to now Mr President-in-Office there has been little progress in the informal negotiations between Parliament and the Council Parliament merely sets out its views and the Council takes note of them
We were in the same situation with the Austrian Presidency and we have very little time left now to conclude important agreements
Mr President Mr President-in-Office allow me to link the beginning of your speech with the end
You said that the main priority was Agenda and ensuring that it reached a conclusion on time while at the same time you said that you hoped for our cooperation
I think you should have added something there
It is not that you hope for our cooperation but that you need it
The financial perspective forms part of the Interinstitutional Agreement and by its very definition the Interinstitutional Agreement is an agreement between institutions
Therefore it is not enough for you to reach an agreement with the members of the Council You must put forward a proposal that Parliament is satisfied with and as Mr Mulder pointed out it will require votes to be approved
What proposals can you put forward that might satisfy us
Have you already considered some kind of flexibility mechanism or would you prefer us to apply Article 
You cannot call for more Europe in every way and more policies try to combat unemployment and proceed with enlargement while providing less funds to do so
I think that a clear proposal is needed here And in conclusion I would like to ask whether we are soon going to see signs that social democrats are in the majority in the Council
Mr President Mr President-in-Office of the Council except for the fact that you once used the term Agriculture Council you have actually succeeded in speaking for minutes without even once really mentioning the reform of agricultural policy as the agricultural spokesman for my group I do feel a little hurt
But I will probably manage to stop myself from asking you your views on voluntary set-aside since you will certainly not be able to answer that question
But there is one thing I would like to know
I understand from a major German newspaper that as from the year for field crops for beef and for milk products the respective compensatory payments will be reduced cumulatively by % a year and that the intention is to reuse only % of these cuts for special agricultural measures which means that % goes back into the EU budget
Let me ask you quite plainly if this % of aid is removed again then as I see it that will lead to a spectacular increase in the net contributor position of some states
That in turn will produce a further redistribution at the cost of those who already pay a large amount into the EU and get far less back
I would be grateful if a little more could be said about this issue at least in relation to Agenda since it does after all have something to do with agricultural policy
Mr President we already had an opportunity yesterday to exchange views with the presidency of the Council on Parliament demands in relation to the Social Fund
But who could know better than you Mr President-in-Office that political demands can only succeed if they are repeated again and again
Yesterday you announced that the German Presidency of the Council felt great sympathy for our concerns
Yet I would like to formally ask you again today whether the German Presidency of the Council is also prepared where necessary to actually firmly support these demands in the Council namely the demands that in future % of Social Fund money is allocated to preventive labour market policies and specific aid measures for women that people who are already marginalised socially are given an opportunity to work through the Social Fund that the Member States assume obligations in all five intervention areas and that the target groups are designated centrally and finally that in future % of Social Fund resources for global subsidies is earmarked for local projects
Mr President Mr President-in-Office we are aware that this is an important time we are planning for the next seven years before the beginning of enlargement which will transform so many things
The atmosphere surrounding the negotiations does not seem to be particularly optimistic Instead there is a vague but nonetheless real feeling of renationalisation
I only want to make a brief comment on the structural policies
You said that you believe that solidarity is a key ingredient of the European Union
Solidarity in structural terms is not something that is easily achieved but it is something that is in fact required by the single market
Will funding continue to be allocated to the structural policies
Will the Cohesion Fund be maintained
Are you going to accept the budgetary level of EUR million proposed by the Commission which many Members here consider to be a minimum
Mr President Mr President-in-Office of the Council I hope that you will reply to three questions
The Commission is proposing with Parliament support that the current Objective regions be incorporated in a new Objective region
There are excellent grounds for this as the northern geographical situation with its long distances and the fact that it is so far away from European centres puts the Objective regions in a much weaker position than many others
What progress has been made on this in the Council
There has been much forceful discussion on the issue of employment not least during the German Presidency how is this matter viewed in talks on structural policy
Will greater importance be attached to the issue of employment in the Objectives and criteria
Border area cooperation is often regarded merely as cooperation which is linked to borders
Is cross-border inter-regional cooperation now to be developed with border areas being seen as a broader cooperation issue
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would be happy to answer the questions I have noted down questions
Do I have minutes speaking time No
So I will have to try to summarise the main subject areas and give combined answers
First all the questions relating to supposed results are pointless
So far there are none except for the two I mentioned
There is agreement on the efficiency reserve and there is agreement on the question of the consistency of national aid regions and EU aid regions
But these two agreements are also conditional on an overall agreement being reached
Let me tell you at the outset before the European Council meeting in Berlin there will be no advance agreements on any of the questions you have raised here simply because the global package has to be made up of many many components components that will bring the individual Member States advantages and disadvantages
The Member States assent is bound to depend on the overall balance the package produces for each Member State
We are talking about a lot of money for the individual states
Unfortunately the political majorities in the Council play no part at all here
During the deliberations each country naturally looks to the needs and interests of its own people and tries to reconcile them with our common European objectives
I am not counting on us being able to obtain advance results on important individual issues before Berlin because the global package has to balance out the different interests
Most of the questions in fact suggested that agreement or plans already exist on these issues
Nor has the German Presidency made any compromise proposal at all at this stage
After all our duty as the presidency is not to put all our efforts into pushing through the German point of view our duty as the presidency is first of all to sound out where the broad lines of a compromise are emerging and then when the time is ripe to propose that compromise
And that is what we will do
But at present we are still trying to narrow the options
I gave you a few examples of areas where we can already see majorities and perhaps also consensus beginning to emerge
But this process is not complete yet on any single important issue
One Member of this Parliament referred to public opinion in the Member States
That is something I take very seriously and which the German Presidency also takes very seriously
Let me just point out to you that public opinion in Europe is not united on these questions
I am well aware of public opinion in Spain
But public opinion in Germany for example is quite the opposite of what it is in Spain
The same applies elsewhere
So there is no point in telling the presidency about public opinion in a particular country
We have to concentrate on finding a solution that is acceptable to all and consistent with our European objectives
Let me confirm quite specifically that one of the objectives of Agenda and we treat it as such is to concentrate available European resources more emphatically on the objective of combating unemployment
That is one of the key objectives of the whole operation
The people of Europe see unemployment as the main challenge and expect us to do everything possible to combat it effectively
Agenda can make a major contribution towards that
I also confirm specifically that the Agenda is directly linked to the question of enlargement
I do not believe that the question of dates is really important at this moment
In any case there has never been a fixed date for the enlargement process
Neither the Council nor Parliament nor the Commission nor the applicant states ever fixed a date
Agenda also establishes the preconditions for enlargement
If we do not manage to conclude the Agenda by March that will send out a discouraging signal to the applicant countries
That is another reason why it is so important for us to conclude the Agenda in good time
In view of the conditions under which Parliament is meeting today with farmers and tractors outside on the street let me point out that agricultural policy forms one component of the global package
It is not a question of agricultural policy alone
That policy is a component of it in terms of financial volume and given the structure of our budgets it is of course the biggest component
A large majority of Member States are convinced that agricultural policy must also play its part in achieving the overall result which is to say it must also be reformed firstly in relation to compatibility with the WTO competition rules and secondly in relation to the financing of the European Union after enlargement
Since the specific question was asked let me also say quite clearly that the objective of a European agricultural policy cannot and must not be to jeopardise or even destroy farming
On the contrary the objective of European agricultural policy must be to preserve farming in all the European regions for the future
The presidency for its part is convinced that the proposals that are under discussion after all we are still only at the discussion stage do not tend in a direction that would allow us to say that farming no longer has a future in Europe
I can understand that you would like to be able to discuss concrete agreements now
But that is not possible because given the negotiating process that is under way the global package will in fact not be tied up until March
In cooperation between the presidency and Parliament we opted for a procedure that is now gathering momentum rapidly
We are meeting more and more often and are also discussing more and more subjects
We are fully aware that we need Parliament assent
During the discussions in various forums the presidency does indeed point out that when the various national positions are put forward account must be taken of the European Parliament opinion
However I must admit that some Member States take this more seriously than others
And some people seem to think we can just leave it to the presidency to decide how it will then persuade the European Parliament to agree to the results of the special summit
In any case we are endeavouring to incorporate as many as possible of Parliament views in the results of the summit
That is why I am grateful for all the ideas put forward in this debate in the form of questions
Let me assure you that we will take account of all these ideas comments and recommendations in our deliberations
Thank you Mr President-in-Office
The debate is closed
Mr President on a point of order
As a Member of Parliament who has sat through this question-and-answer session I find it particularly unsatisfactory that after a lot of statements the President-in-Office has in the end such a short period of time in which to answer about questions
A much better way to hold this sort of debate which is vital is to inject some life into it and apply the Brussels format we use to question the Commission on occasion
At present it really does not work This is a vital subject for European citizens
This has been a dead debate where few Members have been able to ask questions but even fewer have received answers
I shall bring your comments to the attention of the Bureau Mr Teverson
Situation in Kosovo
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Kosovo
I give the floor to the President-in-Office of the Council
Mr President ladies and gentlemen the contrast could hardly be more glaring While you ladies and gentlemen are discussing how the Member States of the European Union can live together more unitedly under a common European roof a few hundred kilometres away in Rambouillet the issue being discussed is whether they can live together under any kind of common roof
That shows the strategic challenge Kosovo represents for the Union
Here we have the single market and the dismantling of borders there a policy that still regards national borders as a means of fencing oneself off as a shield
In line with good diplomatic practice it was agreed that the Rambouillet negotiations would be confidential
They are to be held between the parties concerned and not publicly
So I know no more about them than you who are well-informed politicians
That is why at this point I have to confine myself to informing you that as expected the negotiations are proving difficult that so far both sides are giving no ground at all and that the mediators are currently concentrating on identifying any common areas over and above the differences
Moreover progress reports on this kind of negotiations can be very misleading for the truth is that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed
The European Union has a key role to play in the search for peace
With his preliminary work in Pristina and Belgrade the EU special envoy Mr Petritsch made a crucial contribution to enabling these negotiations to take place at all
He is now conducting the negotiations in Rambouillet together with his American colleague Mr Hill and his Russian colleague Mr Mayorski
That is a great challenge and one in which Mr Petritsch deserves our full support
Incidentally the fact that the negotiations are being conducted jointly by an American a Russian and a European shows that the European Union has now acquired a certain ability to act in the field of foreign policy too
We have certainly not reached our goal but at least we are on the right road
The European Union reacted to the conflict in Kosovo at an early stage
Since spring last year it has gradually established a differentiated system of sanctions in response to the brutal use of force by the Serbian security forces
At the same time it has allocated a substantial volume of humanitarian aid amounting of over ECU million in alone
The EU has supported the independent media to counter the propaganda from both sides
It has also provided aid for democratisation and the development of a civil society in Kosovo
Our political objective was always the same far-reaching self-government for Kosovo together with maintenance of the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and effective protection of all minority rights
At its last meeting on January the General Affairs Council again confirmed the European Union position
Let me briefly repeat the key points
One the European Union is seeking a political solution
The use of force by whichever side only exacerbates the conflict and inflicts even greater suffering and misery on the people
Two in this context the European Union supports the political solution proposed by the Contact Group which forms the basis of the negotiations in Rambouillet
Three the European Union is calling on Belgrade to fulfil in full the undertakings it gave to the OSCE and NATO and to comply with the demands of the UN Security Council
Four the perpetrators of the Racak massacre cannot go unpunished
Their names must be transmitted to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
Five the European Union calls on the Kosovo Albanians to fulfil their commitments vis--vis the UN Security Council in full
It condemns KLA provocations that give added impetus to the spiral of violence
Six the European Union supports the OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission which has developed into an important stabilising factor regardless of all the difficulties it faces and emphasises that President Milosevic has assumed responsibility for the safety of the mission personnel
Seven the European Union is prepared to make its contribution to implementing a negotiated settlement
That applies also and in particular to reconstruction
Eight the people of Kosovo must know that the European Union is prepared to help them along the road to peace
On January the General Affairs Council extended the mandate of the former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe González as EU Special Representative for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia until January 
I want to thank Mr González for his willingness to continue with this difficult job
At the same time I call on the Belgrade leadership to cooperate with Mr González and to make full use of the opportunities this offers it in relation to the European Union
Peace and stability in Europe not only demand a successful negotiated settlement in Rambouillet although that is of course the conditio sine qua non peace and stability in Europe also mean that we must regard the conflicts and problems in the former Yugoslavia as a challenge to which we have to find the right which means the European answer
We must strengthen the democratic pluralist elements in the societies concerned We must promote and develop regional cooperation
We must establish cooperation and pre-accession structures that match up to these countries European vocation
Above all of course we must establish peace in this region and show how the people of this region can coexist
The European Union offers its support to that end
However the responsibility for this lies with the warring parties
They must realise that nothing is to be gained through force whereas much is to be lost and that there is no realistic alternative to finding a compromise solution at the negotiating table in Rambouillet
Thank you Mr President-in-Office
I now give the floor to Mr van den Broek for the Commission
Mr President naturally the European Commission is also pleased that the parties have acted in response to the urgent call to begin peace negotiations in Rambouillet
Many more efforts will be made to reach an agreement the presence of the Serbs and Kosovo Albanians in Rambouillet being seen as a sign that they are ready in principle to find a solution
Pressure must however remain at a maximum if an acceptable and workable result is to be achieved
As you will know Foreign Ministers Robin Cook and Hubert Védrine regularly attend in order to help keep the momentum of the negotiations going
The European Commission is also represented in Rambouillet and is contributing to negotiations on the economic and reconstruction aspects of the draft agreement
Next weekend there will probably be a further meeting of the Contact Group at ministerial level
The aim will be to appraise the results to date and to discuss what points require extra effort or attention
For its part the European Commission is making the necessary preparations for its contribution to the process of reconstruction following a possible agreement
In December and January a so-called damage assessment was carried out on the Commission initiative looking at the damage to houses and the basic infrastructure although it was not possible to visit all the areas because of the fighting
Rough estimates currently put the number of homes damaged to some extent at about Initial calculations estimate that it will take EUR million to repair them
The Commission is planning to hold an international donors conference shortly after a peace agreement is reached
But of course neither this nor reconstruction are possible until there is an agreement and a clear will by the parties involved to live together in peace
Given this necessary conditionality the actual reconstruction work can of course only begin when the security situation in the field permits
It is encouraging to see the growing consensus among the Member States and other countries to support a possible agreement with an international force on the spot
That will help further guarantee the reconstruction work
The most important objective of the reconstruction work is of course to allow the thousands of displaced persons and refugees to return to their original homes
The financial resources made available by the Union for this year are limited
It will certainly be possible to make a start on reconstruction but the budget lines available for this which is in fact the budget line for the reconstruction of the former Yugoslavia is also needed to pay for the reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina
The Commission will return to these matters as soon as we know what the international contribution to the reconstruction work is to be and the time-frame involved
Humanitarian aid through ECHO to which the President-in-Office of the Council has already referred will be granted in the meantime
We also want the European Union activities to be very visible which is only possible by coordinating and presenting all our activities as effectively as possible
To this end the Commission presence in Belgrade and soon also in Pristina must be increased and assured
Thank you Commissioner
I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 
Mr President Mr President-in-Office Commissioner on behalf of my group I certainly support the statements by both the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner
I believe I may say without any arrogance but with a certain pride that it was my group that kept pointing out that we need both the offer of talks and the threat of force
Some people here in this House too wanted us to use force sooner but that would have been wrong
As is becoming clear there is still a possibility of achieving what is I hope our common aim through talks and mediation
I do not exclude the possibility of failure as at any conference which would then make it all the more necessary to use force
But the opportunity that now exists really must be used to the full
The President-in-Office of the Council named names
I am glad that a European representative is playing a prominent role
And I take a personal pride here for before becoming ambassador in Belgrade Wolfgang Petritsch was a colleague of mine and he really is doing a splendid job here which is much appreciated
But I am concerned not with personalities but with the matter itself
And that is the importance of having a European Union representative playing the most prominent part here
Secondly I consider it just as important that not only the Americans but the Russians too are involved
People often disregard the fact that we also need to remind Russia and the Russian Government of their responsibility for this continent
Given that it does have that responsibility Russia must play its part in finding the solution to ensure that it is a lasting solution
On behalf of my group let me also repeat that we are against borders being forcibly redrawn in today Europe
If any changes are to be made they can only be made on the basis of a final consensus not by force not unilaterally
If necessary troops will have to be deployed as the Commissioner said to ensure longer-term security
I have no illusions about a solution being found overnight and I would ask everyone in this House to remember that it is not just Kosovo that is under threat now but that the entire region will be under threat unless we find a sensible solution FYROM and Albania too
It is most important for the European Union to urge Albania in particular to listen to the voice of reason and the voice of consensus
It is important to have Albania as a whole on our side not a divided and divisive Albania if we are to achieve a common solution here
In that sense I fully endorse the statements by the President-in-Office and the Commissioner
Mr President ladies and gentlemen my dear Mr Verheugen we did nothing about Kosovo in the early days
We have known what is happening in Kosovo since 
We took no notice we only took notice when we ourselves triggered the KLA movement
Those are the facts and anyone who denies them has not been watching the story unfold
Today we applaud ourselves and pat ourselves on the back for providing so much funding which we would never have had to provide had everything not been destroyed had the West intervened sooner
Our group also supports the Rambouillet negotiations
And I am glad the Europeans are playing a more important role but as always of course they are too late
I hope they are not entirely too late but I believe we should realise that we could have made an earlier start for instance last October
Many people would not have died in Racak and elsewhere if we had done in October what we are doing now
NATO threat of air strikes must be credibly maintained
Here I am addressing some Members of this House who are against this
With the unconstitutional destruction of the autonomous status of Kosovo in Milosevic set in motion the disintegration of Yugoslavia as a whole after which he stirred up nationalist resentment with his Kosovo propaganda
He is now facing the end of his pointless policy of violence against the Kosovo Albanians and will try to extend theday deadline by any means possible
He does not and cannot want a solution to the Kosovo conflict forced upon him by the West
For then he would lose all international significance and would finally have to govern his people
And then his political mediocrity and incompetence would very soon become apparent
The long-overdue prosecution in The Hague would then also become inevitable and our countries would have to produce the evidence in their possession
So the NATO threat is indispensable
Should an interim solution be found in Rambouillet as we hope it will it would have to be safeguarded by ground forces to protect the Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo
But even if no solution is found air strikes alone cannot secure our objectives
We will need ground forces then too
We are all hoping to see results but at the same time we expect the West and NATO to show their steadfast resolve otherwise we will bear responsibility for throwing away this last chance
Mr President I think that this is the time for hope hope that the negotiations in Rambouillet lead to positive results
Parliament has often called for effective international action on Kosovo Unfortunately it has come too late for those who have already died those who have lost their homes and their belongings and those who have become refugees
Nevertheless we must support the efforts made and the substance of the plan proposed by the Contact Group
If we do not want these problems to spill over into other countries the solution to the conflict must undoubtedly allow Kosovo to enjoy broad autonomy within internationally recognised frontiers
This is the first thing that must be done
I think that three very clear points must be taken into consideration
The first is that we must continue to exert pressure on the parties involved to persuade them to reject the use of violence as a means of achieving their objectives
Secondly if NATO is going to carry out military operations the international High Representative should clearly be European as is the case in Bosnia where excellent results have been achieved
Thirdly as Felipe González has pointed out on many occasions we must not forget that President Milosevic and the absence of democracy in Serbia are the main causes of these conflicts If we do not get rid of them further conflicts are bound to arise in the future
Mr President ladies and gentlemen it is true that the European Union has acted with too little effect and too late
But the difficulty is and remains that if the Council is divided no unanimous action is possible
Parliament was also divided in its opinions
So let us not condemn others when we are facing the same difficulties ourselves
I believe it is a good start that work is now being done towards a political solution
The whole question is whether or not the present offer of extensive autonomy comparable to that of Montenegro will be sufficiently convincing for the Albanians after all that has happened and after the radicalisation which has taken place within the various movements there
My question remains what about the big stick
There is always agreement that pressure must be kept up and I share that view but how can we apply pressure on the KLA to honour its commitments
It is not only the Serbs who fail to keep their promises
The KLA is also guilty of this as we have seen
We therefore believe that a solution must be sought in a common approach to the whole of the southern region of eastern Europe
Mr President I would like to begin with a question to the Council
I would be grateful if you could tell me whether or not Rambouillet was a European Union initiative or a Franco-British initiative as I did not quite understand this point
Having said that I will now follow on with what our colleague Mr Carnero was saying
The Serbs that is the Serbian people are the ones that have been forgotten in Rambouillet
Once again Europe and the Council in particular is counting on Mr Milosevic
I believe that Milosevic is part of the solution as he clearly represents the problem and I do not have bleak doubts like Mrs Aelvoet who wonders whether or not the KLA is going to respect its promises
We are dealing with a man Mr Milosevic who has shown himself to be an expert in this field
I think that these are fundamental issues
The Council tells us that it will apply pressure to put an end to this situation and to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice We therefore also need to know if it will analyse the statements in the press which are communications between the operational units in Kosovo and the leaders in Belgrade in order to show that the chain of command does not stop in the working-class areas of Kosovo but that it goes directly to Belgrade
I hope that we will thus go straight to Milosevic and that Europe will adopt a clear policy on this issue because it is obvious that the criminals those who committed these acts received very clear orders from Belgrade
The deputy attorney general of the court in The Hague was saying nothing less than this when he said that it was time for the member countries including some of the Member States of the European Union to pass on the evidence in their possession that proves that the chain of command goes from the villages of Kosovo right to Belgrade right to the heart of power in Belgrade right to Milosevic
It is time that this was done and I would ask the Council to respond to this point
Mr President history teaches us that it is hard to tell who is good or bad or cruel or kind in the Balkans
Likewise historical accuracy requires us to recognise that for the Serbs Kosovo is their original homeland just as Israel is for the Israelis
If anyone wonders why intervention in the Kosovan tragedy has come so late I would cynically suggest that it probably suits some people to destroy and then rebuild
All the same we welcome the attempt to resolve the conflict through diplomatic negotiation guaranteed by the international institutions
Yet we cannot deny that the European Union role is too weak and it hardly amounts to a common foreign policy when some Member States take a view of the Balkan question which is the complete opposite of the position of other Member States including their view of history
The complex Balkan question has its roots deep in time in the history of these people and in their traditions and cultures
There is one incontrovertible fact which must never be forgotten in trying to find a way out of the present tragic situation
The integration of the two civilisations Muslim and Orthodox is becoming impossible because the nature of each is so strong and the two cultures so diverse So the aim must be coexistence
That is becoming vital unless we want to see the current conflict perpetuated and where there is conflict there is also violence ethnic cleansing genocide abuses and violations of human rights
Europe can no longer tolerate such an explosive situation rooted more in ethnic than geopolitical considerations continuing to develop on its doorstep
That is why we believe that coexistence respecting the different values and cultures must be the goal
This kind of conflict cannot be resolved by war nor can the Belgrade Government restore peace to the region by arming the police
But the Kosovans cannot be allowed to use the profits from drug-dealing to buy arms to perpetuate the war
Uprooting people from their land and the land of their fathers where their identity is rooted will always be a source of new tragedies and future conflict
The best way to ensure peace is to find means of making coexistence possible with guarantees for both parties
So we think the most appropriate political and institutional solution would be the widest possible autonomy for Kosovo within a constitutional framework which guarantees it backed by the international institutions and the European Union
In turn Europe can and must contribute to economic development in the region and become both for the Serbian people and for the people of Kosovo a reference point for a peaceful and balanced Federation
Mr President despite the intensive effort by the international community acts of violence remain the rule in Kosovo
The OSCE observer mission is not having the desired effect
The dreadful massacre in Racak on January marked a new low point in the conflict between the Kosovo Albanians and the Serbs and it ended the uneasy cease-fire which was imposed in November
It is not only the Serbian forces but also the KLA which is proving increasingly effective in its guerrilla tactics which are responsible for this daily violence
As a result several thousand people have again been forced to flee their homes
There is and was good cause for the international community to be more active in its intervention
Brutal violence the ethnic cleansing of the civilian population and the destabilisation of Yugoslavia must be stopped
Those who commit all these crimes must also be brought to justice
My group strongly supports the Contact Group and the proposed draft peace plan with a transition period in order to establish substantial autonomy for the Kosovo region This is a precondition which my group has always supported
The talks in Rambouillet are a final attempt to arrive at a workable solution without military action by NATO
Parliament also therefore supports NATO preparations for intervention as a way of applying pressure in order to ensure a successful outcome to the negotiations
I would add that it is also important for us to prepare to send troops as part of the implementation of any agreement
During the talks pressure is being applied to the Serbs and to the Kosovo Albanians to agree on a solution to the conflict
In order to prevent the Rambouillet talks from playing into the hands of the KLA it has quite rightly been made clear to the Kosovo Albanians that the only way of having a NATO peacekeeping force in the area is for them to make genuine efforts to reach complete agreement with the Serbs on interim autonomy for Kosovo within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
It was in March last year that the conflict broke out in full force
That is nearly a year ago
It is time all the parties to the conflict reached agreement
We therefore also call on the European Union and its Member States to play a clear and active role in ending this conflict
We should like to express our support for the action of the British and French Governments and also express our appreciation for the efforts of the German Presidency
As the European Union we are taking the lead
Let us continue to do so
I say again this is not about Kosovo past but its future and the future of the people who live there
It is not a question of being right but of being put in the right
Mr President-in-Office there is no question of breaking the confidentiality of the Rambouillet meeting the negotiations were obviously secret
But perhaps you could tell us a bit more because having heard that a start has been made but it is an uphill task and there are difficult issues we do still need to know that if Rambouillet fails there is a fall-back plan for resolving the problem and dealing with the aftermath
As has been said we cannot rely solely on the parties involved acting responsibly that would mean Europe policy had failed again
The Commissioner mentioned the idea of a peace-keeping force possibly being stationed in the area
But the broader and more important question the German Presidency needs to confront is the creation at last of a general framework for the whole of the former Yugoslavia Fires are being lit even now in Macedonia
The newspapers say nationalist tension is breaking out again in Brisco between Muslims and Serbs and the situation is heating up
The European Union as a whole needs to succeed in implementing a policy across the whole area
What guidelines are there beyond mere emergency intervention beyond mere stopgap solutions to a difficult situation
What general guidelines does the European Union intend to pursue to establish a genuine peace process for the whole area
That is the question and we hope that Germany will be in a position to launch the debate on this issue
Mr President like Mr Bianco we too would have preferred to have had answers from the Minister and the Commissioner to the questions raised and the reservations expressed by many people about the opening of these negotiations
Naturally everyone in this Chamber hopes Rambouillet will succeed in defusing the Kosovo time-bomb but plenty of people in this same Chamber can see in the political-military approach some alarmingly counter-productive factors liable to make that bomb explode with an inevitable chain reaction of associated flare-ups
The threat of military intervention assuming it can make either party to the conflict less intransigent which is not necessarily true would prove counter-productive once it ceased to be a threat
NATO aircraft would be KLA aircraft to all intents and purposes and would also involve the prospect of an intervention force
Such a force could only be commanded by the OSCE with a NATO component and a UN mandate and it should obviously include men and resources from the Russian Federation
And then there is the problem of Albania which continues to provide a means of transit for massive arms supplies to the rebels
But the stress should be on diplomatic political and economic pressure and the imminent deadlines that were rashly imposed on the Rambouillet negotiations should be extended to leave no alternative unexplored which might eventually be acceptable to the two parties involved
Mr President I have to say by way of prologue how refreshing it is to hear a government minister admit he does not know any more about a situation than we do
I welcome the statement by the President-in-Office
We have to recognise that although frequently in these debates about Kosovo it is all doom and gloom for Parliament tremendous progress has been made and two points in particular should be reinforced
The fact we have negotiations now is largely due to European Union leadership
At long last we are taking effective action and I congratulate the German presidency on the progress made and indeed the British Foreign Secretary and French Foreign Minister also
Secondly as the Socialist Group has always demanded we have managed to keep the Contact Group together and indeed have now got Russia actively engaged in pursuing peace
This is very important and we must not do anything to undermine the cohesion of the Contact Group
Of course the background of the NATO military threat has been absolutely essential as we in the Socialist Group have always insisted
Clearly our next great challenge will be if these negotiations drag on
We have set a timetable
Inevitably negotiations go on beyond a timetable but we clearly must not be sucked into the kind of manoeuvring we have seen in the past with one side or the other deliberating dragging on negotiations for much too long
We must be clear that we are ready at literally hours notice to carry out the threats that NATO has made to bomb Yugoslavia if it is not prepared to reach appropriate conclusions in the negotiations
We must be clear that we are not going to commit ground troops until there is a political settlement
We should not send one soldier from the European Union or from NATO to risk his life unless we as politicians have delivered a political settlement
In doing this we must put particular pressure on the KLA
It has been very easy for the KLA to provoke the Serbian forces into inappropriate responses in order to win international sympathy
We must make it clear to the KLA that they can gain only if there is a political agreement which will give them a large degree of autonomy
Only then will we as a European Parliament sanction the sort of reconstruction effort that Commissioner van den Broek has indicated
We have to ensure that in condemning the Serbian side we are equally tough on the Albanian side and do not out of sympathy for one side or the other provoke a worse situation than exists at the moment
Finally we must I think as Mr Wiersma has said avoid the trap of constantly reciting history in this dispute
We have to look forward to a system of government that would allow the Balkans finally to be at peace enabling economic reconstruction to go ahead and prosperity to be built for the future
Mr President Mr President-in-Office Commissioner we thought of having this debate after the Racak massacre but I do not really think we can make a major contribution today with the Rambouillet Conference still going on
All the speeches we have heard have been interesting but it is difficult for us to speak at a stage which is quite properly secret as you said Mr President
But not everything needs to be kept secret
Of course secrecy is right at diplomatic conferences but for instance the Council and the Commission could help the European public understand who is helping the combatants when fighting breaks out
Why do we always have to wait two three four or even five years
Why do we only find out who is supplying the weapons by reading about it in the newspapers
Why do we not improve prevention given that informing the public is a means of prevention
Having said that I support the work the presidency has done
I think it is important for the European Union to take the initiative and demonstrate to the public that it has a greater political role than it had in the past even though our humanitarian role our aid for democratic development and our support for the growth of civil society remain the priorities
These are all extremely important but they do not add up to actual political weight
I do not want to condemn the European Union entirely of course because I think its role is on an upward curve
But the point I want to make is the same one as I made last time we debated the situation in Kosovo
We are not dealing with a great area of peace serenity tranquillity progress and economic development which just has one rather serious recurring problem of inter-ethnic conflict
No Mr President-in-Office Commissioner we are looking at a part of a larger problem
The strategic limitation of our operations and I mean the operations of the European Union the United States Russia and all the other countries involved is that we persist in looking at one piece of the mosaic and forget that even if we were to succeed in finding a solution to the Kosovo problem there would still be the Balkan question
That is the point
We need a Rambouillet which lasts for years involving far more players
We need a standing conference with Albania Bosnia Serbia Croatia and Bulgaria participating
I know that is very difficult but we should be looking at the whole Balkan scenario because the situation will not be resolved even if and we hope it happens as soon as possible a solution can be found for Kosovo
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I want briefly to address three aspects that were brought up during this important debate
First what can the European Union actually do
We should realise that we have neither the political nor the material capacity to resolve the Kosovo conflict by ourselves
It was necessary for various institutions namely the Contact Group the European Union the OSCE NATO and the United Nations to work together in close coordination which they managed to do by using their great political prestige and all their energy and that is a special achievement
Five different international levels had to be coordinated
That was the only way to create the necessary political legal and military conditions for this initiative
And in fact all this was achieved in less than ten days
Mrs Pack rightly asked why nothing was done earlier
The question should really be handed back to her because the government I represent here was not in office at the time
But I would have liked to see an earlier German Government 
Heckling by Mrs Pack
Yes it was a German Government
I would have liked to see it put forward this initiative
So I do not know why it did not but we are now in the present time It has happened now because as it turned out the agreement the American special envoy Mr Holbrooke reached with Milosevic last autumn did not hold up because Milosevic did not keep to it
Let me make it quite clear again the European Union was not in a position by itself even to provide the necessary military backup to build up a credible military threat
It does not have a single soldier it could have used as a threat
So we should not just keep saying that the European Union has simply gone on making mistakes in Kosovo
You must realise that it is not exactly an easy task to get these institutions to work together to keep the Russians and Americans in the same boat to make the Contact Group effective
I could also make a few comments on the difficulties in the Security Council on the need to gain Russia support but most of that has already been addressed
The second point I wanted to make is this once an interim agreement has been reached which is of course what Rambouillet is all about it needs military backup
What I am talking about is the military backup for an agreed settlement
I am not talking about military intervention against the will of the warring parties
That is an entirely different matter
What we are seeking is an agreement now in Rambouillet which would initially be a three-year interim agreement
During that period it will certainly need the military backup of a SFOR-type operation
A number of European states have already declared themselves willing to make ground forces available to that end including the UK and Germany but others too so it is highly probable that we can set up a sufficiently large and also robust operation
We must use the time between the Rambouillet agreement that we hope to reach and the expiry of the interim period to prepare a Balkan conference that will do what several speakers have called for namely look at the overall picture and finally move away from a policy that focuses only on one issue and forgets that all these individual issues are interrelated
It is the presidency intention and this forms part of the EU initiative that the UK France and Germany jointly put forward that we work towards that conference with the aim of establishing stability security and cooperation throughout the Balkan region
That is a very very ambitious project
We will only achieve it and this is my third point if we can define a clear and convincing strategic perspective for that part of Europe
I said this morning during the discussions I held with the Council of Europe on behalf of the presidency and I repeat it again the situation we are facing is a confrontation between two different concepts of Europe
This Chamber here represents the Europe of the st century the Europe of integration of peace of democracy of human rights and therefore also in the final analysis of man prosperity and personal welfare
The Europe we see before us in Kosovo in Bosnia and sadly also in other parts of Europe remains imprisoned in the atavistic attitudes of the th century
We must make it clear to those people that they have the choice of joining the modern forward-looking Europe of integration or remain imprisoned in the conflicts the blinkered attitudes the nationalism of the th century which can only result in misery oppression and the loss of human lives
But we must at least make it clear to them that they have this choice
That means we must also be willing to offer the prospect of integration into Europe and do so with all the institutions and instruments available to us
It is certainly a very long-term prospect
I am speaking not of years but quite certainly of decades
But even the longest journey requires a first step
The time has come for us to take this step
I am in fact confident and as for all the business about secrecy in Rambouillet well those happen to be the rules
You know that and it would be naive to believe that we could have genuine negotiating results interim results so early on or that if there were any we could present them here
But let me put it this way the fact that the delegations are still talking that they have come in the first place that there was no game-playing at the outset for example we wont sit in the same room or so-and-so cannot participate or we will only talk under such-and-such conditions the fact that the negotiations have been going on since Sunday does suggest that the participants are looking to achieve results
In a few days time the Contact Group will present its evaluation of the results so far then it will be time to decide the further procedure
I would definitely contradict the speaker who protested because the negotiations were being put under such time pressure
A major component of the chosen strategy is to put the warring parties under the strongest possible pressure which includes the pressure of time
I firmly believe that a negotiating approach that allowed the warring parties to play for time would fail
So there is a certain element of pressure and it is very strong
You must remember that they were not prepared to come to the negotiating table in the first place they only did so in response to a very strong and severe threat and ultimatum issued by the international community
Part of it was that the negotiations must produce results within a given time frame which was deliberately made very short
In summary I want to say that we Europeans may now have shown an improved ability to act in foreign and security policy
Mr Swoboda was right to say that it is an initiative in which the European Union has played a prominent role which shows what we can achieve if we are creative and use our imagination
Mr President-in-Office may I cordially ask you not to forget that when you come here you are not a German minister but the President-in-Office of the Council who speaks for the Council
I have always spoken my mind to the gentlemen of the Council and apart from once they have always been gentlemen of whatever political persuasion they happen to be without regard for party politics
If I have a complaint to make against the Council I will do so and you are now representing the Council for six months
Next time it will be a Finn and I will not treat him with kid gloves any more than I do you
You are here not as a German minister but as President-in-Office of the Council so please do not be so touchy and do tell your people back home that we are not attacking the Germans here but the presidency
Mr President speaking as an Italian and since you referred to the countries involved in the problems of the Balkans I just want to say that as well as France Germany and the United Kingdom Austria and Italy are also involved and they are crucial countries in the area
The debate is closed
The vote will be taken tomorrow at am
OCTs ACP countries and remote regions continuation
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report A by Mr Aldo on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation on relations between the Overseas Countries and Territories OCTs the ACP States and the ultraperipheral regions UPRs of the the European Union
Mr President first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Aldo on behalf of the Socialist Group on producing a brilliant report for the Committee on Development and Cooperation a report he pressed for and felt very strongly about
In today debate we are looking at an issue that is important for the development of territories which are very diverse in terms of legal status and levels of development but which at least share a geographic location
Overseas countries and territories ACP countries and ultraperipheral regions do in fact differ and the Union has rightly established a range of instruments for them
To be frank I am not entirely convinced by everything in Mr Aldo report
But I think we must support its basic political message which is the need to deepen relations between the three different groups through intensive decentralised cooperation with a view to achieving harmonious territorial development
The report essentially deals with the outlook for the ultraperipheral regions and OCTs and that is what the European Parliament is expressing its opinion on today
But I do think it is absolutely vital to involve the countries of the Caribbean and the Pacific fully to listen to their ideas and their requests and make sure that any initiative is in their interests too
The full involvement of all interested parties in the consultation and decision-making process is very important
The report also deals with issues relating to commercial regimes
Here it is essential to proceed with great caution because even recently difficulties have arisen from abuses of the special rules relating to OCTs
The aim of encouraging the commercial integration of UPRs OCTs and ACP countries is undoubtedly laudable but its implementation must respect the special position of the ACP countries and take place in the context of the definition of new broader rules linked to the new post-Lomé Convention the new GSP the CAP reform and the WTO rules
At the same time the interests of all European farmers must be taken into account in the context of the common organisations of various markets
As a whole however this own-initiative report sends an important and positive message Closer external cooperation and more refined instruments will mean that even those territories of the Union which are geographically most marginal can find new roles and embark on new development paths which will also benefit neighbouring developing countries
That is an important message and it has our full backing
It is the reason our group will vote for the whole report as approved in committee although we still think some specific points need further study
Mr President ladies and gentlemen in my opinion the report by our colleague Mr Aldo is a significant text
It is significant due to way in which it was prepared because it affirms the natural desire of the regions countries and territories concerned to establish regional partnerships It is also significant because of the proposals that it puts forward
During a fascinating meeting the Committee on Development and Cooperation listened to representatives from the overseas regions and overseas countries and territories
That was a new experience but it was a fundamental moment in Parliament understanding of the problems needs and plans of Europeans from other corners of the globe
Such a dialogue was necessary and must be continued in as many contexts as possible
Indeed the report makes proposals in this respect and we support them
As I said a moment ago this report affirms the natural desire of the ultraperipheral regions and the overseas countries and territories to establish regional partnerships
This is obviously extremely important for them for their development and for their future However it is also and perhaps above all essential for the Union because the Union will be involved in each of these partnerships adding a particularly important dimension to its cooperation with the ACP countries
To some extent this is recognition and affirmation of the Union global dimension of its economic role but also and above all of its political importance
We should not only accept these partnerships rather we should support them and help them to develop
In order to achieve this the rapporteur makes several proposals
In the time I have available I would like to mention just one of these the establishment of devolved units of the Commission in the ultraperipheral regions and the establishment of offices or contact points in the overseas countries and territories
This suggestion comes notably from local elected representatives in an ultraperipheral region and I would thank the rapporteur sincerely for having included it in his text thereby giving it weight and strength However this suggestion must not just be wishful thinking
If Parliament adopts it tomorrow we will have to closely monitor its implementation
Little by little it will become an essential element of the cooperation between the Union and the ACP countries and we will have to pay particular attention to this
Mr President the committee adopted this report by a large majority and I think it is the result of lengthy discussions
It describes the pressures on island regions that are remote and isolated from the economic centre of the Union
It points out that there are three different kinds of subregions which must be consulted must be involved in the decision-making and here I believe the reference to new ACP negotiations is important
The reference to trade to the generalised system of preferences and to the need for a coherent policy is one of the key points of this report and a key to the future negotiations
We should support the concrete demands set out in relation to telecommunications research and development education and training and the prevention of natural disasters
I believe we all agree on the need for regional integration
However the use of the term Caribbean Europe on page of the report reflects both the problems that exist but also in my view a problem we have been carrying around with us since colonial days
Would it not make sense to consider these three subregions together to give them independence to link them into a regional association through a new treaty and to help them in that endeavour so that we can finally be through with this episode of old colonial history
That is a thought and an idea worth considering because I find this demand and the very term Caribbean Europe quite incomprehensible
I am in Europe I am in this economic area I am in this trade area which we want to shape and control democratically
And the people of other regions want the same
Do we not want to support regional developments
Our resolve for the future should be to pursue this idea further
Mr President on my own behalf on behalf of Mrs Taubira who has been detained due to threats of various demonstrations and on behalf of my group I would like to express our total support for the particularly relevant initiative by our colleague Blaise Aldo He is finally proposing that we take a global and consistent view of the regional relations of the ACP countries the ultraperipheral regions of the Union and the associated OCTs
As regards the OCTs and particularly the one I know best the territorial collectivity of Mayotte I agree entirely with the analyses made by Mr Aldo and by Mr Castagnède the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy They highlighted the lack of legal precision the economic inconsistency and the social injustice of the situation created in the OCTs by the European Union
Mr Aldo tells us that they are the poor relations of the European Union
He is absolutely right He could have highlighted the paradox that exists in that when it comes to the European Union internal solidarity the OCTs are not rich enough to be with the rich and when it comes to the Union external solidarity they are not poor enough to be with the poor
I would like to take a few examples from Mayotte of the inconsistency of our situation
Mayotte for example is not part of the European Union but it votes in European elections
In order to develop Mayotte needs stable and sound legal rules
Community law does not apply there either directly or automatically through a process of incorporation into national law
It is applied at the whim of the instructions for implementation which are a feature of the special legislative system
We are also told about economic development through local production but Mayotte which is already at a disadvantage due to its limited market the fact that it is an island and the cost of labour is penalised by the rule of non-reciprocity of the preferential arrangements granted to the ACP countries in its region
Finally I would like to mention one last example Mayotte imports everything from the European Union but the only sources of tax it has are those that involve penalising its own imports with customs duties
This is why I believe that the only solution for the OCTs and I would ask my colleagues to make a clear distinction between the OCTs and the overseas departments is to totally rewrite Article of the Treaty This would allow them to assert their full membership of Europe and particularly through local decisions to bring the wealth of their diversity and their particular characteristics to the European Union
Mr President the June Movement can only applaud the fact that the Committee on Development has taken the initiative to produce a report investigating the connections between the Overseas Countries and Territories the ACP States in Africa the Caribbean and the Pacific and the ultraperipheral regions of the European Union
It is important that the projects supported by the EU in these areas are coordinated and that the EU takes more account of them in its own policies
There is an advantage in promoting decentralised and regional cooperation among the OCTs themselves and with the ACP States because this can help promote their development
It is therefore important to enter into a dialogue and to develop an equal partnership which respects each of the partners characteristics
We neither can nor should sit in Strasbourg and dictate what this cooperation should be aimed at
In the first place that is unworthy
Secondly the countries themselves naturally have the best understanding of the local conditions
However as the Committee of the Regions points out we can encourage cooperation financially in areas such as research and development technology transfer education and culture the improvement of sea and air connections environmental protection and access to information technology
And we should also ensure in the negotiations on international trade that we maintain the trading privileges enjoyed by the OCTS and the ACP States
In that way we shall also promote the thing on which all our discussion of development should be focused namely the fight against poverty
Mr President ladies and gentlemen we must congratulate our colleague Blaise Aldo on the outstanding work he has done
It is a mark of his realism his wisdom and also what I would call a healthy empiricism and these are all qualities that in general are rarely evident in this House
However this is only a report and I believe that it shows the fruit of his work and his considerations
I also believe that it clearly demonstrates other political currents and forces and I would like to share some of my reservations with you
In principle we cannot accept the risk of a drift towards the progressive assimilation of our overseas departments and territories into the ACP countries
This is a considerable risk and it becomes evident when we read between the lines
For us and I would like to clarify this for the French people that we represent our overseas departments our overseas territories Réunion Mayotte the West Indies New Caledonia Polynesia and Guyana are French territory just as much as our departments in Metropolitan France
We are aware of their particular characteristics and we constantly stress the need for national solidarity in order to face the challenges of their remoteness their demography and their economic situation
I would also like to say that I listened very closely to what was said by our colleague Mr Hory He knows a great deal about the situation and his remarks were entirely relevant and sensible
For example unemployment is very high in Réunion and in the West Indies Therefore we should not devote our efforts to integrating unlimited numbers of immigrants
Indeed the volume of such immigration is becoming unbearable and more and more tragic and it also affects our department of Guyana Nor should we try to overcome the effects of losing the connection with one roots the failure to adapt and the refusal to assimilate or the effects of the presence of communities that want to be increasingly dominant and overpowering
We wish to see a different Europe and a different system of cooperation with the ACP countries although I cannot expand on this in the context of these proposals However we are not questioning the specific proposals that our colleague Mr Aldo rightly sets out in his report such as those on fisheries
We would like to say that this is a good report
Nevertheless we do have certain concerns based on our sense of national interest and the interests of our overseas departments and territories It is therefore with a certain amount of regret that we abstain on this report pending further consideration
Mr President I think that we must begin by clarifying what the actual aim of the Aldo report is
It does not try to define the status of those regions of the European Union that are outside the European continent Their status has already been defined
The ultraperipheral regions form part of the Community territory and have equal rights
The citizens of those regions including myself and Mr Aldo are therefore voters and can be elected representatives within the European Union We live in regions that are situated far from the continental heart of Europe but we are members of the European Union in the same way as any Community citizen
There is clearly a certain ambiguity as regards the British French Dutch and Danish overseas countries and territories as some of these regions still seem to be evolving Nonetheless they too are still territories of the European Union
The ACP countries are independent and are sovereign states
No-one is trying to regulate their status or to assimilate them
On the other hand the Canary Islands where I am from clearly form part of the European Union and will continue to do so as they have been a part of Spain since the fifteenth century
The purpose of the Aldo report is to use the European Union potential in these far-off regions to help to promote one of the EU aims namely development aid
The ultraperipheral regions and perhaps to a greater extent the overseas countries and territories have a relatively low standard of living compared with the Community average although it is still much higher than that of the ACP countries
The proposals in the Aldo report are aimed at establishing a relationship and this is of particular importance for the region where Mr Aldo himself lives the Caribbean The geographical distribution there rather affects the situation and the status of each of the regions
I believe that these are positive proposals as Mr Vecchi said
They probably need to be examined in more depth but the fact that the Commission is using these regions as platforms for development aid operations is a positive step This is a way of promoting a certain degree of integration between those regions and their less developed neighbours
This report by Mr Aldo is an own-initiative report and is clearly not binding
The Commission could therefore use some of the points and proposals made by Mr Aldo as a basis for specific proposals that would allow both the ultraperipheral regions and the overseas countries and territories to play a serious role in its work to support development aid in the rest of the world
In this respect I believe that we should welcome this excellent report by Mr Aldo For me it represents at least the beginning of one aspect of the Community action in the area of development aid
Mr President the debate on the report by Blaise Aldo has the merit of being politically expedient
The ACP countries have often shown their support for an increase in regional cooperation in the fields of politics economics trade and culture This was particularly evident last spring during the meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Mauritius
The European overseas territories are increasingly calling for greater consideration so that they can participate in a developing world with a globalised economy
We must remember one basic fact the overseas territories are not territories of the Union but their inhabitants are Community citizens and we must never forget about them
The Union ultraperipheral regions enjoy a specific status which has been incorporated into the Treaty of Amsterdam as primary Union law If they are capable of making the most of their geographical situation they will be able to play a role in the future development of the Union relations with ACP countries for example within the framework of Interreg
There are many examples of interregional cooperation including Réunion in the southern Indian Ocean the French overseas departments in the Caribbean and the cooperation between the Canary Islands and certain countries in western Africa These cases demonstrate the possibilities offered by cooperation we cannot ignore them
Three weeks ago the general secretariat of the ACP Chamber of Commerce met in the Canary Islands with a view to establishing its headquarters there This is just one of the many examples of cooperation
For these and other reasons we are going to vote in favour of the Aldo report
The Commission is aware of all the points we have made I would therefore like to end by asking the Commission for its opinion given the absence of a legal basis on how we could bring all these elements together so that three different entities might be able to cooperate and help each other
Mr President the Committee on Development and Cooperation welcomed this own-initiative report on relations between the overseas countries and territories the ACP countries and the ultraperipheral regions of the European Union
Blaise Aldo the rapporteur has completed a significant report and I congratulate him on his bold conclusions
Mr Aldo has shown us that we had a duty towards these regions
They are strong in their originality and in their diverse cultures identities and statuses They are true representatives of the European Union in the world as they are also outposts in the Caribbean the Indian Ocean the Atlantic and the Pacific and they embody the European model in their values of democracy and freedom
Moreover our cultural and historical links with them mean that we must support and cooperate closely with them
Despite our trade agreements and our specific programmes we had never succeeded in holding a global discussion on the future of these regions and on their relations with the ACP countries
At a time when the Union is engaging in a threefold process of renewing and renegotiating the Lomé Conventions it was fitting to review its association with the OCTs and to implement a form of adapted integration with the ultraperipheral regions
I believe that the discussion led by Blaise Aldo comes just in time as it is becoming essential for the European Union to promote harmonious economic and social development in these regions and to help them to integrate into the international and commercial system and face global competition
The second is its economic dimension with the establishment of a European Fund for developing economic and social projects And the last point is the establishment of representative offices of the European Union and contact points to promote training and information projects for individuals or whole populations
I naturally support the rapporteur proposal to maintain the current trade arrangements in other words free access for products from the OCTs under conditions that would not harm the interests of the ACP countries
To conclude I believe that the Commission should pay a great deal of attention to the Aldo report so that this document might result in specific proposals
Mr President when I look at the globe and consider the regions we are discussing it almost makes me feel dizzy to think about the problems around the world that we are tackling from here in Europe
First and foremost we have special obligations towards the ACP states
The rapporteur whom I congratulate on his work pointed out in his explanatory statement that developments in these regions in the OCTs are not particularly positive in spite of favourable conditions
I do not know whether we are taking the right approach to changing this situation
On the one hand he proposes a range of administrative measures on the other a range of financial measures
I would like to see more emphasis put on the regional approach to which some previous speakers have repeatedly referred
For I believe that is where the best chances lie for development that we must exclude the long-distance approach from the outset and focus more on cooperation within these regions
Although I am a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation I still have a few problems with some of the paragraphs and sections of the report
First there is the question of enhanced Union citizenship which it discusses but that is after all tied to very definite conditions Then there is the question of a special fund under the Community budget
Here I fear that we would to some extent be restricting ourselves tying ourselves down and losing flexibility Thirdly there is the idea of setting up offices or contact points in all these countries which I also see as an added administrative burden without any obvious benefits
Mr President I too would like to stress the importance of the Blaise Aldo report for which I thank him
He is right to call for attention to be paid to these regions which have just been described and he looks among other things at the issues of trade and equal treatment with the ACP countries
As regards the funds I also have questions like those raised earlier by other speakers such as Mrs Günther
But I am not yet convinced that this is the best solution
It is also striking that it is largely the French who are conducting this debate and unfortunately I find that I am the only Dutch person to speak on the subject despite the fact that the Netherlands Antilles are also concerned
It is very noticeable too that there are no Englishmen present yet they also have overseas regions
There are two kinds of overseas regions
There are the Overseas Departments and there are Overseas Territories
The Overseas Departments are exclusively French
We say in the Netherlands that the Overseas Territories are a sort of poor relation in that they are treated rather differently and it is on this that there is now a major conflict again
This sometimes results in bizarre situations
The Netherlands Antilles for example have Sint Maarten while the French have Saint Martin
That is simply the other side of the island
On our side there is the airport while the French side is European territory
It is amazing that no graduate student in the Netherlands or France has written a thesis on what this means for Europe border controls and the like
Finally Mr President I believe that we must also look at the treatment of the Overseas Territories in relation to the Overseas Departments
If these Overseas Departments have such a special status what does that mean for the Overseas Territories
I should like to know whether in the future as a follow-up to the Aldo report which I repeat is very important the Commission will also turn its attention to this matter
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I am standing in for Mr Mendes Bota who is unable to be with us
The possibility of a new tripartite regional set-up with closer economic social and political links between overseas countries and territories the ACP countries and the ultraperipheral regions of the European Union could not have come at a better moment
Mr Aldo report opens up new avenues towards a new type of development aid a new model that differs considerably from traditional aid as provided for until now in the Lomé Convention the old EDF or in bilateral agreements between rich countries and developing countries
At present there is a dangerous decline in world solidarity
In state aid and private credits in the OECD countries earmarked for cooperation fell by billion dollars to billion the lowest level for a decade
We need to reverse that trend and these regional and sub-regional partnerships could prove to be an investment with a visible return for all interested parties
The institutionalisation of the OCTs and the ultraperipheral regions of the EU as special partners under the Lomé Convention particularly by including them in the new Joint Assembly deserves a warm welcome from us
By the same token we also support overall the very diverse range of proposals and ideas contained in the draft legislative resolution in this report
With special reference to the ultraperipheral regions of Madeira the Azores the Canary Islands Réunion Guadeloupe Martinique and French Guiana we should stress that they are not only furthermost frontier of the Union but also genuine strategic centres for strengthening trade relations with various regions around the world as well as local beacons of democracy and freedom in the Atlantic Indian and Pacific Oceans
The European Union should set up delegations in those regions with decentralised powers to coordinate support actions as part of the regional cooperation debated here today
Mr President ladies and gentlemen first I want to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Aldo on his excellent work and the impassioned way he has imparted his own experience in this report
There are certainly parts of the world where ACP states overseas countries and territories of Member States of the Union and ultraperipheral regions which are an integral part of the European Union coexist in one region
The Third Lomé Convention covering first introduced the idea of strengthening cooperation between these three groups with differing status
Now in parallel with the negotiations for the Fifth Lomé Convention which opened on September between the European Union and the ACP group and the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty the future of the ultraperipheral regions and overseas countries and territories will begin to be considered
Undoubtedly we need to take a keen interest in these territories and distinguish them carefully
One point the rapporteur highlights and which I particularly want to stress is the fundamental importance of disaster prevention
This has also been stressed by the group on climate change for the small island states which I chair in the Joint ACP-EU Assembly because these territories are particularly vulnerable and need our assistance especially as the activities vital both to their economies and to social welfare principally develop along the coastal strip
Mr Aldo has looked at these problems in great detail and I think he should be strongly supported especially as a report along these lines is to be approved at the next Joint Assembly
Mr President my colleague João de Deus Pinheiro deeply regrets that he is unable to address you this afternoon
I am very honoured to replace him in the debate on this matter as the Commission welcomes the work that has been done by your Committee on Development and Cooperation thanks in particular to its dynamic rapporteur Mr Aldo It also welcomes the work carried out by the committees that were consulted for an opinion and their draftsmen Mr Castagnède and Mr Souchet
This work resulted in an own-initiative report that is very detailed due to the wide range of subjects it covers including financial trade humanitarian and geopolitical issues
It is also complex due to the various types of status to which it refers the ultraperipheral regions of the Union the four overseas departments the Canaries the Azores and Madeira the countries and territories associated with the European Community and the ACP states with which the Union is currently negotiating a future partnership agreement
I would like to add that this is a bold own-initiative report and I think that that is the best compliment that can be given to Members
It often goes very far in asserting certain concepts that have yet to be realised
Examples of these are the decision to do away with the unanimous procedure governing the association of the OCTs Article of the Treaty or the establishment of free trade areas in the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean involving ACP countries overseas territories and overseas departments Other examples include the establishment of a special fund for the development of the OCTs to be included in the budget and the plan to give a voice to the OCTs through some sort of involvement in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly
Elaborating your ideas coming up with revolutionary concepts and drawing up daring proposals are the most important contributions your institution can make to help the Commission and the Council
The Commission for its part has also entered into extensive discussions on the OCTs
The results of this will be submitted to Parliament through its Committee on Development and Cooperation at its meeting in April
The Commission plans to consult local leaders on the results of its discussions
The ideas taken up in your own-initiative report will be very useful to the local representatives involved during these consultations
Finally they will also be of great use to the Commission as it will have to draw up proposals following these various consultations
The debate is closed
The vote will be taken tomorrow at am
Coffee and chicory extracts
The next item is the report A by Mr Lannoye on behalf of the Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Directive relating to coffee extracts and chicory extracts CCOD
Mr President I hope my presentation will be sufficiently brief to allow us to settle this matter
Parliament has been called upon to give its opinion on the joint plan approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive on coffee and chicory extracts
I would like to point out that this is one of seven proposals on food products
Along with coffee extracts chocolate honey fruit juices jams tinned milk and sugar were originally the subjects of a joint debate that took place in October 
However these were separate proposals for directives that were naturally inspired by the same idea of simplification in order to facilitate trade But those seven proposals had varying results
Only the one that we are discussing today managed to come this far
The political and technical obstacles as well as the differences in opinion between the institutions the Council the Commission and Parliament have in my view been overcome to the complete satisfaction of Parliament
Indeed after a Council common position in which Parliament three amendments were rejected due to an unfavourable opinion from the Commission Parliament then confirmed the amendments at second reading
That was in September
Two months later the Council rejected the amendments again which meant that the Conciliation Committee was convened
What do the amendments involve
Two of them one a recital the other an article aimed to keep the principle of limitation of the range of nominal weights available on the market in the directive
That appears to be a technical matter
In fact it is a little more than a technical matter
The purpose is in fact to prevent any confusion for consumers and unfair competition for producers
Needless to say these amendments were widely supported both by consumers associations and by producers associations which is unusual
The third amendment related to the method of analysis of the free and total carbohydrate content for which the European Parliament wished to apply Standard ISO of February which is the most modern method available
At technical meetings and in a tri-partite meeting between the Council the Commission Ken Collins chairman of the Committee on the Environment and myself it became apparent that the disagreement was not a political one and was based more on methodology than on substance
We therefore gave our agreement to a compromise which was endorsed in the Conciliation Committee in December This compromise alters the common position of the Council by first of all introducing a new recital into the text
This recital announces a Commission initiative to be introduced before July that aims to introduce a range of nominal weights for coffee and chicory products in horizontal directive on weight ranges
Parliament aim is thus clearly achieved by a different method but what matters is that we achieve the same result
Secondly paragraph of the annex to the directive includes a clear reference to the methods of analysis of the carbohydrate content which allows the use of the most modern methods but without making the text rigid by limiting it to a particular method
Here the Commission concerns which we found to be legitimate were taken into consideration
I will conclude by saying that the political balance of this conciliation is in my opinion entirely satisfactory
Moreover it has been unanimously approved by the Committee on the Environment and I feel that it is essential that Parliament votes in favour of it
I therefore call on the House to support this report
Mr President I should first like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work on a subject which he has presented so clearly
This has become a rather technical dossier in which it is hard to see the wood for the trees but it nevertheless deals with a subject which is of concern to people in their everyday lives namely their cup of coffee or at least what appears to be coffee
People rightly expect us to also take these matters seriously and deal with them thoroughly which is what has happened in this case
At second reading we adopted a number of amendments with which the Council did not immediately agree but in the end conciliation has produced a good result
Everything finally went so smoothly that the official Conciliation Committee became no more than a formality
The PPE fully approved the present result in the Conciliation Committee and we will also of course do the same here in the plenary
I would just like to add that I hope that progress will also be made on the other six proposals to which the rapporteur has referred in principle including chocolate and also the other points in the package originally submitted to us and that here too we will ultimately arrive at a satisfactory result
I would like to know whether the Commissioner has any idea of the timing
When can we expect something Commissioner
Then we will have a better idea for planning our own work
Mr President I just want to make two comments
First I want to congratulate the rapporteur and also Mr Collins on the very good result they have achieved
We have an excellent compromise that really can be supported in all good conscience
Secondly in the case of chocolate it depends upon whether the Council can make up its mind to adopt a sensible position
That is not entirely out of the question although we will have to wait and see
Thirdly this is the shortest speech I have made so far
The debate is closed
The vote will be taken tomorrow at am
Question Time Council
The next item is questions to the Council B
Question No by Roy Perry H Subject Media ownership concentration
Does the German Presidency plan to address the ramifications of increasing media ownership concentration in particular when this leads to dominance in other economic spheres ie sport
I should like to welcome Mr Verheugen and ask him to reply to Mr Perry question
Mr President Mr Perry let me preface my answer to your question with the following
As President may I specifically state on behalf of the Council that it attaches the utmost value to protecting freedom of expression of which the freedom of the media is one of the most important factors
The Council is profoundly convinced that freedom of expression is a cornerstone of democracy and of the other individual freedoms as stated years ago in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
That is why the Member States and the Community check very carefully within their sphere of responsibility that access to the media is assured in all areas of society taking account of the variety of political and religious convictions
As regards consulting the Council on questions of media ownership concentration let me point out that to date the Commission has not submitted any proposal on the subject to the Council
Of course the Council would consider any such proposal in detail
In this connection let me draw the honourable Member attention to the fact that the question of concentrations between undertakings comes under the Community competition law specifically in this case Council Regulation EEC No of December on the control of concentrations between undertakings
Responsibility for applying that regulation lies with the Commission
Mr President I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his response
I of course like all democrats totally share the views expressed about the necessity of a free press in democratic societies
The problem I am seeking to address in this question is that concentration of media ownership sometimes causes problems with freedom of the press particularly when that concentration of ownership stretches beyond just ownership of newspapers and into other economic fields
Many European citizens are concerned when they see for example the takeover of Manchester United by BSkyB the extension of the ability of broadcasters to strike deals with particular football clubs and the proposals for a European Super League
All this could be challenging the freedom of sport to operate as it has up to now
I would like to think that when a report comes from the Commission the Council will address that issue
Mr Perry I fully sympathise with your concern
But let me point out again that this matter comes under competition law
We have definite legal bases for this within the European Union and the Commission is responsible for applying this law and implementing the regulations
This matter has to be dealt with in the Commission and that is the appropriate procedure
Let me repeat that the Council is prepared to consider the matter if the Commission puts the appropriate proposal before it
Question No by Hans Lindqvist H Subject Depopulation of the Swedish countryside
Not since the s has there been greater depopulation of the Swedish countryside
The population has declined in some of the municipalities in Sweden mainly in inland central and northern Sweden
Membership of the EU was to have strengthened regional policy so that the country as a whole could be developed
The reality has turned out to be different
The present trend is unacceptable
Can the Council hold out any hope for those regions in Sweden which are now severely affected by depopulation
Will the approximately SEK billion refund on Sweden annual membership fee of SEK billion increase or decrease in the future
I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Lindqvist question
Mr Lindqvist the Council is aware of the problem of depopulation especially in certain parts of the Union and has always attached great importance to measures to maintain a viable population structure in rural areas
As for aspects related to the reform of the common agricultural policy during the deliberations on the Agenda proposals the Council envisages formulating a European agricultural model that will have to be further developed in the future namely the model of a multi-functional sustainable competitive agriculture that exists throughout the Community which means also in regions that have the kind of specific problems to which you refer in your question
The Council acknowledges that rural development policy has a fundamental role to play in endeavouring to make use of every means of preserving viable rural structures throughout the European Union
Under EU regional policy Sweden currently receives structural aid for its least populated regions
Until December the Structural Funds the financial instrument for fisheries guidance and the European Investment Bank will each continue to make their respective contribution to achieving a priority objective which is called Objective 
That objective is to promote the development and structural adjustment of very sparsely populated regions
As is also provided in the second recital of Protocol No of the Swedish Act of Accession these rules are currently being reviewed in the context of the Commission proposals on reforming the Structural Funds
For the period from to the Commission proposes continuing the fund aid for Objective regions under Objective 
As for the progress of discussions within the Council I can tell you Mr Lindqvist that in addition to this Commission proposal there is another one from the Member States on which no decision has yet been taken
It proposes that the existing Objective be retained and the aid measures continued
This will be decided on in the context of the global package of Agenda on which I reported to you during this afternoon debate
Thank you for that reply
Today demonstration by French farmers in support of their livelihood and their very survival provides a graphic example of the situation in this part of Europe
The same problems exist in Sweden particularly in the north of the country
Three or four farms close down every day
It is the small farms with to cows whose owners are forced to give up and move to the cities above all to Stockholm Malmö and Göteborg
There has not been such a dramatic migration away from the inland communities since the s
Of the local authorities that exist in Sweden all of them in the interior of the country have lost part of their population
I have a supplementary question concerning Objective 
Could the Council provide more information on whether Sweden and Finland are to remain as Objective regions and will the Objective criteria be included in the new framework for Objective 
I would appreciate an answer to this question
Mr Lindqvist we are fully aware of the problem
I myself was informed of it in detail by the Swedish Government in Stockholm last Sunday
Let me repeat that in addition to the Commission proposal there is another one that will be decided upon
Only when it has been decided what funds will be available in future for structural aid in sparsely populated areas and not just as you rightly said in Sweden and Finland but also in other parts of the Union can the decision be taken on the concrete shape of such a programme
Will the President-in-Office assure Parliament that it will be able to have full details of every subsidy from the agricultural funds so that we can do something about the fact that % of the farmers receive % of the subsidies while % of the farmers receive % of the subsidies from the EU and about the fact that these % together receive less in income than we as consumers and taxpayers pay in subsidies ie that a large amount of money disappears somewhere between the two
Mr Bonde I do not think I need tell you how the present system of the EU common agricultural policy came into being and how it has developed
It is based on decisions that were taken in years gone by
At this moment we are about to embark on a reform of European agricultural policy that is aimed at making agriculture in Europe more competitive more productive more sustainable and more ecologically acceptable
The Commission proposals to that effect are on the table and what I have just said holds true here within the Council the Member States have very different ideas about the final shape of the reform of agricultural policy
Some Member States even think we should not make any changes at all
I am expecting the Agriculture Council which will be meeting from to February to give us the first insight into the agriculture ministers view of the future of European agricultural policy
It is too soon to do so today
I cannot answer this question today because the relevant decisions have not yet been taken
I appreciate that the President-in-Office cannot anticipate the outcome of the structural fund reforms but would he draw the attention of the other members of the Council to the fact that there is serious concern in this House that the Commission proposal for Objective I namely applying the strict criterion of % of GDP is unfair to some regions of this Community
On the regional question if you take the Highlands and Islands of my own country Scotland you will find that it is a very rural area in danger of greater depopulation
At over % it would seem to be the very sort of area that we should be defending in this reform
Yet if we stick to the Commission strict % it will lose out
Mr Martin I am happy to do what you say and draw the Council attention to this fact
You will not be surprised if I say that one Member State has already done so and is doing so very insistently which means that the Council is very well aware of this problem
I must add however that the deliberations to date show that a broad majority within the Council is in favour of an extremely strict application of the % criterion for Objective regions That is partly because there are of course also a number of areas that come just below that threshold and a few that are just above it
The trend as I see it at present is to continue to apply this criterion strictly
But the Council is fully aware of the problem
I will see to it that Parliament and your concerns are taken into account during the further deliberations
We should now be taking Questions Nos and together but as the author is not present Question No lapses
Question No by Christine Oddy H Subject Amnesty International and the European Union human rights policy
Is the Council of Ministers aware that Amnesty International has marked the th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with the publication of a report on EU human rights policy
What steps is the Council of Ministers taking to evaluate this report with a view to using its main recommendations to flesh out EU human rights policy
I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mrs Oddy question
Mr President Ms Oddy the Council attaches great importance to the human rights activities of non-governmental organisations
It pays great attention to the NGOs opinions and recommendations and seeks contacts and exchanges of experience with them
The same applies to the question of fleshing out the European Union human rights policy
In that respect let me point out that in December the then presidency of the Council distributed the Amnesty International report referred to by Ms Oddy to the CFSP Working Party on Human Rights
The Council agrees with Amnesty International on the importance of seeking constantly to further improve EU human rights policy
In that endeavour the Council will also pay attention to Amnesty International proposals
The Council would refer you to the declaration published on December on the occasion of the th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which was subsequently confirmed by the European Council
The declaration of December contains a range of operative proposals and the Council will be discussing their formulation in the coming months
On January the General Affairs Council confirmed this
The follow-up to the operative proposals in the declaration of December forms an important part of the presidency work programme
It includes the question of an annual EU report on human rights
The work programme also gives high priority to the endeavours to gain recognition of the EU positions on human rights policy in relation to specific countries and issues in the framework of the United Nations
That includes the important questions of the reform of the UN human rights mechanisms and preparations for the world racism conference
As I have been war-wounded getting here and fallen over I shall expect a better answer than I got from the Commission yesterday
I should like to know about the EU code of conduct on arms sales
I should like to know whether a common list of military equipment is adopted in that code how many licences have been refused and what progress the Council and Member States are making in this area
As I said I shall expect a better answer than I got yesterday which was dreadful
No I cannot and above all I will not do so for major reasons of principle
I cannot see that this supplementary has any relevance at all to the original question that was put
The presidency could not be prepared for this question
I am not about to give you an answer on such a sensitive matter off the top of my head so to speak
I am quite willing to give you a written answer
But as I said I cannot see that the supplementary has any relevance to the actual question
Thank you Mr Verheugen
Mrs Oddy you cannot come back on that again
You are well aware that during Question Time you can only have the floor once
Mr Verheugen has offered to respond to you in writing
You will therefore be able to have your question answered by him in that way as he has promised
However in accordance with the Rules I must now continue with the next question
Question No by James Provan H Subject Humanitarian aid to the Russian people
In the resolution on humanitarian aid to the Russian people adopted by Parliament on November attention was drawn to the outbreak of tuberculosis in Russian prisons where up to % of the prison population are carriers of the disease
Will the Council instruct the Commission to propose an action plan to combat the danger that Russian carriers of tuberculosis might infect other sectors of the Russian population neighbouring peoples and sooner or later European Union citizens
I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Provan question
Mr President at its meeting in Vienna the European Council reaffirmed the EU solidarity with Russia and its people during the current economic crisis
For that reason on December the Council adopted a comprehensive programme to supply agricultural produce to Russia
Since ECHO has spent ECU m on humanitarian aid for Russia
A sum of ECU m remains from the allocation for 
After checking where the people were in greatest need it was decided to concentrate on trying to resolve the problem of tuberculosis especially in the prisons
The Commission and the Council therefore entirely share the concerns expressed in the European Parliament resolution of November and the concerns voiced by Mr Provan
With the new outbreaks of tuberculosis in the developing countries prisons became the main breeding ground for this disease
Russia has the highest rate of imprisonment in the world % of the total population
Russian prisons are overcrowded
In many penal institutions up to % of inmates are infected
That is why the Commission decided to use the lion share of the ECU m remaining from the budget namely ECU m for projects to stem the tide of tuberculosis
As you know the ECHO aid is dealt with by NGOs in the EU the United Nations agencies and international humanitarian organisations
Thank you very much President-in-Office of the Council for a very full reply
I am concerned about tuberculosis and I am glad to know that the Council is making a major proportion of the funding available to that end because it could be a serious problem
Regarding the other aspects of agricultural products that might be going to the Russian people at the present time I believe that part of the programme is going to allow the food aid that is sent there to be sold on the local market at existing market prices
The main problem however is that the people do not have the funds to pay for it
There is insufficient funding in the economy at the present time and that is a major problem
What assurances can the Council therefore give us that any produce that is sent from the European Union to Russia will in fact find its way to the actual people who need help
Mr Provan you have addressed a very grave problem and one which the Council in fact considered at length during a very serious debate
Indeed we are facing the dilemma of on the one hand recognising a humanitarian obligation and wanting to help while on the other we know that in the country we want to help we come up against structures that often stand in the way of achieving the purpose of the aid
The Council has therefore laid down a political guideline for the Commission to the effect that when these products are supplied to Russia it must be ensured that they do indeed reach those who are in greatest need that this does not disrupt any remaining food supply structures that still work and that it helps promote a viable policy for securing future food supplies to the people
That was the Council intention
It has proved extremely difficult to apply these political conditions in relation to practical aid
That is why I am persuaded that the Council will have to look into this whole issue again at once
Question No by Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos H Subject Security in Cyprus
Given that the EU and some Member States in particular had raised objections to the initial plan of the Cyprus Government to site a surface-to-air missile system consisting of Smissiles on the island and subsequently congratulated it on its decision to cancel the plan how does the Council feel that Cyprus should improve its security
I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Dimitrakopoulos question
Mr Dimitrakopoulos in the European Union view the way for Cyprus to improve its security is to continue seeking a political solution to the problem of the division of the island
Here Cyprus can continue to count on the full support of the European Union and of the entire international community
The European Union takes the view that there are already far too many weapons in Cyprus producing a real risk that each new build-up of weapons on one side will immediately be matched by the other side which will lead to less rather than more security
For this reason the European Union welcomed the decision by President Clerides which Mr Dimitrakopoulos mentioned not to site Smissiles on the island of Cyprus
That decision sent out an important signal about reducing the excessive number of weapons in Cyprus and the European Union hopes both sides will take further steps in that direction
The decision not to site those missiles has removed one of the sources of tension on the island
The Council believes this can promote progress towards a just and lasting solution to the Cyprus conflict
The European Union strongly endorsed UN Security Council Resolutions and and fully supports the ongoing efforts of the UN Secretary-General Deputy Special Representative for Cyprus
Mr President I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his reply
There are two additional points I would like to make
Firstly the President-in-Office talked about further measures which could be taken by both sides
Bearing in mind what has been said so far and the statements that have been made what kind of measures does the Council expect to come from the Turkish side
Secondly is there any prosect of Cyprus becoming a member of NATO when it joins the European Union in order to solve the security problem
Or at least is there any prospect of deploying a NATO force on Cyprus which will enable the Turkish and other armed forces to leave the island
Mr Dimitrakopoulos the Council principal demand to the Turkish side in Cyprus is that it should finally be willing to take part in the accession negotiations
As you know the European Union political strategy here is to start the accession negotiations with Cyprus in the hope that they can act as a catalyst to help resolve the political problem and in the end indeed resolve it
So far this hope has not been fulfilled but we still make the same very clear demand to the Turkish side to take part in the negotiations
In any case of course we call on the Turkish side to keep a low military profile and to help defuse the situation by taking steps towards disarmament
I cannot tell you anything about the possibility of Cyprus joining NATO or about deliberations within NATO on the potential membership of Cyprus since I represent the presidency of the European Union and not the NATO Council
Mr Sánchez-Neyra the Council has not deliberated the matter to which you refer
Nevertheless I can provide you with some information
The Council reaffirms the position it adopted in regard to the agreements reached at the EU-USA summit in London in May 
At that time the Council said that for legal reasons and reasons of principle it firmly rejected secondary boycotts and laws with extraterritorial and retroactive effect
The Council welcomes the new measures taken by the US Government
But even if they reflect a more flexible attitude on the part of the US towards Cuba the Council regrets that the American embargo on Cuba remains in place
Such actions are not the best means of promoting democracy and respect for human rights
The Council still believes it right to seek a dialogue with Cuba as we stated in the common position of December and to support a process of peaceful transition to a pluralist democracy together with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and sustained economic recovery in Cuba
The EU still regards the implementation of the agreements of the EU-USA London summit of May as a priority
But in spite of the efforts of the US Government to date there is still not the kind of progress that would lead the USA to radically review its sanctions policy
I would like to thank the presidency for its assessment of these measures and to put a supplementary question
You are aware Mr President-in-Office that it was agreed at the Transatlantic Summit between Commissioner Brittan and the Clinton administration that the European Union was to withdraw the complaint it had filed with the World Trade Organisation As you know one of the other agreements was that the United States would amend Title IV of the Helms-Burton Act
When speaking before Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs Mr Brittan confirmed in response to a question I put to him that if the United States Congress did not amend Title IV the complaint might perhaps be lodged once again with the World Trade Organisation
Does the Council share this view
If so and I will end here Mr President when would the deadline be
Yes Mr Sánchez-Neyra the presidency does share the Commission view on this question
I cannot tell you anything about time-frames at this point because the Council has not taken a decision on this
I personally think it should happen at the time of the EU-USA summit in June this year at the latest
Mr President-in-Office thank you for the information you have provided However I would like to give you some new information which was received this week by a group of Members from all the political groups who form the intergroup against the blockade affecting Cuba and of course against the Helms-Burton Act which is exacerbating the situation still further
During a meeting the Cuban authorities showed us a letter from farmers in the United States who are putting pressure on Mr Clinton to allow them to sell directly to small Cuban firms or relatives of Cubans in Miami within the context of the recent flexibility measures introduced by the United States Government
Mr President-in-Office you have just said that the situation will have to be assessed in June I would ask you to bear in mind that the paradox might arise that North American farmers are able to sell to Cubans without any problems while Europeans continue to find it very difficult to trade and conduct a normal relationship with Cuba because of the Helms-Burton Act and the blockade which as you know is illegal and contravenes United Nations resolutions
Mrs González Álvarez I am extremely grateful to you for that information and would in fact be most obliged to you if you could as you say put the relevant documents at the Council disposal so that it can take account of them in the appropriate decision-making processes
I would not like to make any political assessment at this moment before actually seeing the documents
I am sure you will understand that
But this course of events you have just described ought also to be considered at the EU-USA summit in June at the latest
Thank you Mr Verheugen
Questions Nos and will not be taken because the subject to which they refer is included on the agenda of this part-session
Question No by Esko Seppänen H Subject Wassenaar Arrangement
At the beginning of December it was decided that cryptographical goods should also be subject to the Wassenaar Arrangement
The EU is not a party to that Arrangement but plans are now afoot for the EU to adopt a Directive on the subject
What are the Council grounds for not allowing free trade in cryptographical goods and does the Wassenaar decision accord with the WTO Agreement
I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Seppänen question
Mr President Mr Seppänen under the Wassenaar Arrangement cryptographical goods always were subject to export controls
At their plenary meeting on and December the contracting states of the Wassenaar Arrangement merely decided to review the rules on export controls for encryption techniques these are known as cryptographical goods
The aim was to relax the export controls and ensure that cryptographical restrictions did not become entrenched
Those contracting states that are also EU Member States were particularly concerned to avoid any rules that would further restrict free trade
It is true that the European Union as such is not a contracting party to the Wassenaar Arrangement
At present there is an integrated system in which the Council the Commission and the Member States exercise their respective responsibilities with a view to protecting the Member States fundamental security interests and fulfilling their international obligations
The Council is currently preparing to implement the Wassenaar decisions
To this end it will amend Council Decision CFSP and adjust the list of dual-use goods subject to export controls pursuant to Regulation EC No which is the dual-use regulation in question
The Council hopes the revised list can enter into force on April 
Mr President-in-Office of the Council did I understand correctly that you mentioned a decision taken at a meeting on and December at the plenary meeting of the states participating in the Wassenaar Arrangement to ease trade restrictions in respect of cryptographical goods
If you did you are wrong
The licensing process was made much tighter at that time and the Member States of the European Union went along with demands mainly from the United States to make the prevention of espionage more difficult
Cryptographical goods are used specifically for protection against Echelon and other spying activities carried out by the USA
Was I right in thinking that you said the trade in cryptographical goods has become less restricted and do you think that this licensing arrangement for trade in cryptographical goods is generally in line with WTO regulations
Mr President yes Mr Seppänen you understood me correctly
Let me repeat at the plenary meeting on and December the Wassenaar contracting states decided to review the export control rules on encryption techniques
So these are the cryptographical goods you mentioned
Under the new rules the export controls have been relaxed
And that was precisely the aim of the EU Member States namely to prevent cryptographical restrictions from being entrenched in these new rules
Thank you Mr Verheugen
Mr Seppänen you cannot speak twice during Question Time
Moreover your speech is not being interpreted It is therefore impossible to continue with this discussion
Mr Rübig wishes to put a supplementary question
Mr President I wanted to ask about the quantity and quality of these systems in the future
Has the Council carried out any analyses
Mr President Mr Rübig I am genuinely sorry I cannot answer this very specialised question offhand
I will have to give you a written answer
Mr Rübig will await your response in writing
Questions Nos and should now be taken together but as the author is not present Question No lapses
Question No by Nuala Ahern H Subject Harmonisation of the OSPAR Agreement to stop further radioactive pollution by nuclear plants of the seas surrounding the EU
What action will be taken by the Council to ensure Europe-wide harmonisation of the agreement to stop further radioactive pollution by nuclear plants of the seas surrounding the European Union in particular Sellafield and La Hague drawn up at the meeting of the ministerial working group of the OSPAR Convention on the protection of the seas held in Dublin last month
I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mrs Ahern question
Mrs Ahern at last year conference of the contracting parties to the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic the OSPAR agreement held in Lisbon the OSPAR Commission adopted a strategy on radioactive material in the form of a political declaration
The goal of that strategy is to prevent the pollution of the marine environment from ionising radiation
This is to be achieved through the continuous and substantial reduction of discharges emissions and losses of radioactive material with the aim of keeping their environmental concentration close to the background values for naturally occurring radioactive material and keeping them virtually nil for man-made radioactive material
In pursuing this aim account was also to be taken of the legitimate uses of the sea technical feasibility and the radiological effects on man and organisms
By the year discharges emissions and losses of radioactive material are to be reduced to a level where any concentration increases above the already existing concentrations are virtually nil
The OSPAR working party on radioactive material that is responsible for implementing this declaration met in Dublin from to January 
The contracting parties agreed to report by autumn on the measures they had respectively planned to reduce discharges emissions and losses of radioactive material
The Council wishes to point out that the question raised by Mr Fitzsimons primarily concerns bilateral relations between two Member States of the European Union and therefore falls within their terms of reference
At the same time the Council would specifically remind him that the nuclear plant he referred to is subject to the Community legal provisions relating to health protection in particular Directive Euratom which lays down stricter standards for the protection of workers and the general public against ionising radiation
The presidency-in-office of the Council can also inform you that the German Government is currently holding intensive negotiations with the UK on the continued operation of the Sellafield reprocessing plant
I will be happy to report to you on this at a later date once these talks are concluded
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council if he thinks that fuel reprocessing at Sellafield can possibly be compatible with the commitment to reduce emissions to zero or virtually nil as he puts it
I note what he says about the intensive bilateral negotiations currently taking place between Germany and the UK and indeed I believe France over emissions
Since significant increased emissions have been documented from THORP and this cannot possibly be compatible with the commitment to reduce emissions to zero
While I am very pleased to hear about these intensive negotiations I would also like to make the comment that according to recent scientific journals there is no question of compensation being paid
Mrs Ahern in your supplementary you have linked two entirely different matters which really have nothing to do with each other
The current talks between the German and UK Governments on Sellafield have nothing to do with the decisions OSPAR took in Lisbon
They are two entirely different matters
There is no link between them
I do not have any way of judging to what extent the operation of the plant to which you refer is or is not compatible with the provisions
As I said this autumn we will be receiving reports from the contracting states on what they propose to do in order to achieve the objectives laid down in Lisbon
Is the President-in-Office aware of the continuing concern of people in particular on Ireland east coast about the safety of the accident-prone Sellafield plant
Is he willing to bring this concern to the attention of the Council with a view to encouraging the British Government and British Nuclear Fuels to cease operations at Sellafield and in particular to stop the reprocessing of nuclear waste
I would ask the President-in-Office if he could provide a clear timetable as to when the reprocessing trade will be brought to an end
This is a matter of great concern to most citizens
Mr Hyland obviously I cannot provide a timetable of this kind because the Council is not currently considering the question of bringing nuclear technology in Europe to an end or the question of when the reprocessing technology will come to an end in Europe
That is a matter for deliberation in the Council
As for the concern of the citizens I believe that the Member States concerned should make these concerns known to the Council
It cannot be the presidency job to discuss a Member State problems if that Member State itself does not wish it
I have a very brief question on the issue of Sellafield
Perhaps the President-in-Office could comment on these remarks from the deputy chief executive of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland printed in The Irish Times He says they do not pose a significant health risk and have been dropping for some time
Could the President-in-Office comment please
Mr President I cannot comment on that quotation because the Council has not considered this matter
Question No by Jan Andersson H Subject Conditions for Swedish adoption of the common currency
The introduction of the euro at the beginning of the year has lent urgency to the debate in Sweden on its possible future adoption of the common currency the timing of which is one of the principal issues
Here it would be valuable to clarify the implications of the qualifying periods for joining the ERM on the date Sweden might adopt the euro
Does the present position of the Council rule out Sweden adoption of the euro at an earlier date than that implied by the qualifying period for it to join the ERM
I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Andersson question
Mr President Mr Andersson pursuant to Article k of the Treaty at least once every two years if not sooner at the request of a Member State with a derogation the Council shall decide which Member States with a derogation fulfil the necessary conditions for the introduction of the euro on the basis of the convergence criteria in Article 
In relation to Sweden that means that in May at the latest the Council will review the derogation agreed for Sweden in May 
If Sweden wishes to adopt the euro at an earlier date it can do so
Many thanks for your reply
The fact that Sweden is not a member of EMU has nothing to do with the Treaty but with public opinion which has prevented a decision on whether to join
However there has recently been a sea change in people views
There is a continuing debate on whether countries would have to have been in ERM II for two years and my question also refers to this since events may move quite quickly in Sweden
There could be a decision next year following a referendum
If that turns out to be the case would Sweden be obliged to be in ERM II for two years before being allowed to become an actual member
Or would it only be necessary to fulfil the criteria relating to inflation interest rates and so on
Mr President I cannot make a political judgment here because this is a purely Swedish matter
In legal terms in terms of the Treaty I can certainly give a positive answer
Mr President I apologise as I refer not to this question but to my own question No 
I am in the middle of an emergency meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens Rights
I wish to apologise to the President-in-Office as I will not be here to take his response
If possible could he give me a written response
In any event when we come to your question I will call your name If you are not here then in view of the explanation you have provided I will ask the President-in-Office to answer your question in writing
As the author is not present Question No lapses
Question No by Mihail Papayannakis H Subject Third pillar and illegal immigrants
What is the position regarding the problem of illegal immigrants who are smuggled into an EU Member State which does not have diplomatic relations of any kind with the countries of origin of the illegal immigrants thereby leaving that State in a quandary over what to do with them
In Greece for example this intractable problem is apparent with immigrants mainly from Rwanda Sierra Leone and Myanmar who have been held in police cells or prison for some months and have been poorly or humiliatingly treated
Could dilemmas of this type be dealt with at Community level by enlisting the help of those Member States which have diplomatic relations with the countries in question
Should there not be specific provisions within the third pillar to deal with such cases which would take into account the principles of human rights fundamental freedoms and respect for private life
I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Papayannakis question
Mr President Mr Papayannakis the Council is aware of the problems arising from situations such as those described in your question
The responsible Council bodies have taken them into account when they discuss the problems facing Member States that want to deport people to certain third countries
Deportation to third countries does indeed call for good cooperation with the state in question so that the necessary formalities can actually be completed
In particular the identity of an individual must be determined before he or she can be provided with the necessary re-entry documents
If there are no diplomatic relations or there are only restricted diplomatic relations that is of course an obstacle to this cooperation
Mr President I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his reply but the real point of my question was this Greece has diplomatic but not consular relations with the countries I mentioned such as Rwanda Sierra Leone and Myanmar
These countries do not have embassies in Athens and I imagine that this must be the case in other countries as well
The upshot of this is that illegal immigrants who have been arrested cannot be set free or expelled nor can they be sent for trial which means that they stay in police custody for months and I regard this as unacceptable
Could not the Council intervene possibly via the consular authorities of these countries in another Member State so that these people can be given the documents they need to solve their problem
Otherwise we end up with something resembling a Kafkaesque impasse
This is my question to the President-in-Office and I would ask him to intervene if he can in such cases
Mr Papayannakis I find it very difficult to answer a question concerning a problem that Greece has with certain other states
To my knowledge what normally happens is that a state that does not have diplomatic relations with a particular other state can be represented in that state by a protecting power
I do not know whether this is the case for Greece but if not the most obvious solution would probably be for the Greek Government to request representation from another state that does have diplomatic relations with the states concerned
Mr President-in-Office I just want to ask whether this problem that is facing Greece is not also connected with two other issues One is the question of common measures to combat illegal immigration the other is a fair distribution of the personnel burden as regards asylum applicants and other immigrants
So long as no progress is made on these issues I fear we will not have a common approach on other such issues either
So my question is on what is the Council focusing in this area in order to adopt a common approach on these two issues
Mr Posselt as you know we do indeed regard this as an important and fundamental issue
But it is not directly linked to this very specific Greek problem
I really cannot tell you how the immigrants from Rwanda Sierra Leone and Myanmar actually get to Greece
But the basic problem you have raised is one that is currently being discussed in depth in the Council and the Council intends to cooperate more closely in this area and to take decisions and decide on joint action here at the latest by the time of the special summit to be held in Tampere in Finland during the next six-month presidency
Question No by Bernie Malone H Subject Access to transport for people with disabilities
Does the Council agree that the needs of people with disabilities should be mainstreamed into regulations for structural funding of Member States transport systems in the light of the recent protest made by Mr John Doyle of Bray Co Wicklow Ireland outside Heuston Station in Dublin after it was revealed that CIE had spent IEP million of EU funding as part of an IEP million investment on the acquisition of buses which did not provide for disabled access
I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Malone question
The Council shares the concern expressed by the honourable Member and by Parliament as a whole in relation to the quality of life and especially the mobility of disabled citizens
Access to public transport plays an important role in this context
The Council concern in this regard is also reflected in the new Article of the Amsterdam Treaty one of the aims of which is to prevent discrimination on the basis of disability
As for the special case to which Mrs Malone referred I am sorry to say that the Council is not aware of it
But since it obviously concerns an EU Structural Fund measure I would suggest that she address this question to the Commission which is responsible for ensuring the proper implementation of EU structural policy
This is one of those rare occasions when cynical politicians get outraged
It happened when I saw disabled people protesting in the rain outside the transport company because of the fact that new buses had been acquired with EU structural fund money and that they were not accessible
There are buses that are accessible
They are in use in London
So this is disgraceful
I hope that the presidency will bring it to the attention of his colleague the Irish minister for public enterprise Mary ORourke and to try to force her to take the needs of disabled people into account in all EU funds expenditure
She will probably tell you that the shape of our roads is inadequate One of the excuses the minister has given is that there is a dip in the roads and the types of buses available in London would not possibly be suitable
I do not find that to be an acceptable explanation
Mrs Malone I would very much like to tell you what I think about this because I really have very specific views which I am sure are not very different from yours
But as you know I cannot do so
All I can tell you at this point is that the Commission would have to check whether in the case you describe there was any infringement of the provisions on the use of Structural Fund resources
It is up to the Commission to do this the Council cannot do so
Presumably today Question Time will as you hoped raise European public awareness of this issue
Thank you Mr Verheugen
We should now be taking Question No by Mr Crowley who was with us earlier and asked Mr Verheugen to answer his question in writing
Question No by Liam Hyland H Subject Tourism
As we move ever closer to the next millennium a time which corresponds to long-term predictions that by the end of the th century tourism would be the biggest industry in the world will the German Presidency outline what new directions it intends to give at EU level to consolidate the strengths of the EU tourism product particularly in relation to the peripheral regions which are dependent on tourism
I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Hyland question
Mr Hyland the Council is aware that European tourism will be a very important industry in the next century
On June the Commission submitted a proposal for a decision on a first multiannual programme to promote European tourism
The subject has been considered several times since then
The Austrian Presidency took it up again and at its meeting of December the Council once again considered the multiannual programme to promote European tourism on the basis of a document drawn up by the Austrian Presidency
In spite of the presidency proposal to shorten the duration of the programme and to reduce the budget funds allocated to it some delegations continued to raise objections
Let me point out that if no consensus is reached the German Presidency proposes the following continuation of the work on this programme taking account of the recommendations made by the High Level Group on Tourism and Employment and renewed consideration of the subject in the light of new developments
Does the President-in-Office agree that rural tourism must be prioritised in the context of the broader EU tourism package and that agri-tourism must be promoted and developed as a means of sustaining farm families and rural communities
Would he agree that rural tourism requires additional funding under the proposed new operational programme for tourism
I am sure the President heart is in the right place when it comes to promoting rural tourism
Mr Hyland I am sorry to have to tell you that there is no agreement in the Council on any of these questions
On the contrary there is much dispute about them
Unfortunately my personal view in this regard is of no significance
But you can guess what it is when I tell you that I myself represent a rural constituency in the German Bundestag
Let me say again the German Presidency will continue nonetheless to try very hard to achieve the consensus that is still lacking and will certainly continue to keep the matter under consideration
Thank you Mr Verheugen
As the authors are not present Questions Nos to and lapse
Question No by Mrs McIntosh will not be taken because the subject to which it refers is included on the agenda for this part-session
Mr Papayannakis wishes to raise a point of order
Mr President I had asked with the agreement of Mr Alavanos to take over his question
Is that not possible
Mr Papayannakis to reach such an agreement with Mr Alavanos the Rules state that a written request must be received from Mr Alavanos before the beginning of Question Time asking that you be allowed to deputise for him
We have not received any such request from Mr Alavanos
Therefore under the Rules you cannot deputise for him
Question No by Ioannis Theonas H Subject Provocative statements by UK spokesman on Cyprus Sir David Hannay
Statements made by the UK government spokesman on Cyprus Sir David Hannay advising the Greek Cypriots to follow the Swiss model which recognises the sovereignty of the Swiss cantons an alternating presidency and equal numerical representation of the cantons have been met with utter dismay and sharp protests by the Cypriot government as well as all political circles in Cyprus
Bearing in mind that such statements are completely in keeping with Turkish views and are contrary to UN Security Council resolutions including the most recent resolutions and will the Council say in what manner it will respond to these provocative remarks which cultivate a climate of tolerance enabling the Turkish side to advance unacceptable positions which contravene all notion of international legality and law and undermine efforts to bring about a just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem
I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Theonas question
Mr Theonas it is for the British Government to react to the alleged statements by the UK government spokesman on Cyprus Sir David Hannay
He is the spokesman on Cyprus for the British Government and not for the European Union
The presidency has information to the effect that Sir David Hannay statements were misunderstood and that the British Government has now clarified the matter
The presidency therefore sees no occasion to comment on these statements
Mr President unfortunately I am unable to thank the President-in-Office for his answer because whether Sir David Hannay represents the British Government or not it is important to state one position on the substance of the declarations
In this regard I am interested in the position of the Council that is if it insists on solving the Cyprus problem on the basis of the recent Security Council Resolutions and and if it considers that a loose federation such as that sought after by Mr Denktash and unfortunately Sir David Hannay appeared to agree with this idea is the solution which the European Union could be happy with in respect of the Cyprus problem and in respect of the process of solving one of the longest-standing problems in Europe
There has been no change to the Council position on the Cyprus question
As I just said Sir David Hannay statements do not fall within the remit of the Council or the European Union and therefore I cannot comment on them
Question No by Nikitas Kaklamanis H Subject German Presidency and accession of Cyprus
The German embassy in New Delhi India reportedly issued an official document on January concerning the German Presidency objectives for the first six months of 
This document makes no reference to the accession of Cyprus to the EU chapter Enlargement of the EU and accession process European Conference pp and merely refers to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe while placing particular emphasis on the promotion of EU relations with Turkey
What are the German Presidency views on this entire matter and when will the mistake of omitting Cyprus from the document issued by the German embassy in New Delhi be rectified
I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Kaklamanis question
Mr Kaklamanis the document you mention does not specify any applicant country by name but refers only to the applicant countries as a group which of course means all six of them
Mr President-in-Office I am not going to beat about the bush
You are here in the European Parliament
This morning when we debated issues concerning the Council the Council was absent which shows a lack of respect for this House You are mistaken if you think that asecond answer is adequate for the question I asked you
This shows contempt for the European Parliament and our intelligence
The contents of the official telegram from your embassy were not disclosed this time by Sir David Hannay but by the representative of the German Government
I would like you to give me a direct answer
Firstly what is the position of the German Government and of the German Presidency That is what concerns me
Is there a question mark over the accession talks concerning Cyprus because the political problem has not been solved
Secondly if the talks end and the problem has not been solved what is the position of the presidency
Please give me direct answers to both these questions
I reject this criticism
The Council was perfectly well represented at this morning sitting it must be left to the Council to decide at what level it is represented
I have nothing to add on the matter
The document you quote does not refer specifically to any one applicant country but refers to all the applicant countries
That means Cyprus in the same way as it does Poland Hungary the Czech Republic Slovenia and Estonia
Thank you Mr Verheugen
Mr Verheugen Mrs Theorin has now arrived in the Chamber for Question Time which she usually attends
The fact that we dealt with the previous questions so quickly clearly explains why she was not present when we came to her question
I would therefore like to ask you if you could perhaps respond to Mrs Theorin question
Question No by Maj Theorin H Subject Nuclear disarmament
Nuclear weapons continue to represent a huge threat to the whole of humanity merely because they exist
The UN General Assembly has decided by a very large majority to support the proposal by Sweden and Ireland for new nuclear disarmament measures
The vote showed a marked change in attitudes towards nuclear weapons the only EU Member States to vote against the resolution were the UK and France
What steps does the Council intend to take to support new nuclear disarmament measures
I should like to appeal to your generosity Mr Verheugen and ask you to answer Mrs Theorin question
Of course I will answer this question
Naturally the European Union is committed to strengthening the Non-Proliferation Treaty and making it universal
This treaty gives rise to obligations on the part of nuclear states to take nuclear disarmament measures
The EU reaffirmed this commitment and took note of the decision in question and of the New Agenda Resolution at the European Council in Cardiff on June thus expressing its position
Thank you for answering my question
My reason for putting it is that nuclear disarmament is at a standstill
Nothing much had happened before the initiative by Sweden and Ireland amongst others which prompted new questions about a realistic way to eliminate nuclear weapons
The initiative was based on the Canberra Commission proposals as they are called
It does not involve anything unrealistic or Utopian but is a practical initiative
I am pleased to note that most Member States of the Union either voted for the resolution or abstained only the two nuclear powers voted against it
I have high hopes that the German Presidency will be prepared to take up the initiative bringing nuclear disarmament a step nearer
Let me specifically confirm again Mrs Theorin that in the presidency view the Non-Proliferation Treaty is one of the most important international instruments of disarmament and international security
The German Presidency attaches the utmost importance to strengthening the non-proliferation system to ensuring that the provisions are respected that the commitments contained in the treaty are fulfilled and that the non-proliferation system can be maintained and further developed in future too
As you yourself just described there are still differences of opinion on this subject among the Member States of the European Union that also applies to the New Agenda Resolution tabled by Ireland Sweden and a number of other states in the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly
Irrespective of these differences of opinion the reasons for which you know as well as I let me also emphasise that there is agreement in some important areas
That means the Council supports the implementation of the decision of the principles and objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament of the NPT Review and Extension Conference
In this context I would point out again that under this treaty the nuclear states have undertaken to totally abolish these weapons in the framework of the general disarmament efforts under strict and effective international control
As the author is not present Question No lapses
Questions Nos and will not be taken as the subject to which they refer is included on the agenda of this part-session
Question No by Patricia McKenna H Subject US breaching UN Conventions
What opinion does the Council have of and how does it intend to react to plans by the US Administration to deploy anti-ballistic missiles in breach of the Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty and to the fact that the US Administration is developing and is likely to deploy weather-modification weapons in breach of the ENMOD Convention Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques
I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mrs McKenna question
Mrs McKenna the Council has not been informed of the US Government plans referred to in your question
Neither the European Union nor any its Member States are parties to the ABM Treaty
But the US Government has declared that it intends to adhere to the core of the treaty and jointly discuss a modification to it with Russia
Some Member States of the European Union are parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques
But to date this convention has not been discussed in the framework of the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy
The European Union has a responsibility here and the Member States that are cooperating with the United States on military matters have an obligation to ensure that international treaties are respected
There seems quite a lot of evidence to back up these allegations
The President-in-Office has said that they are only allegations but there is a lot of information and data to back them up It seems to be fact
The United States would appear to be thumbing its nose at international treaties and it is incumbent on the European Union as regards global disarmament and international security to make sure that the United States is held accountable for what it is planning
Mrs McKenna I am happy to take note of your comments but I cannot predict whether the Council will consider this matter
As the authors are not present Questions Nos to lapse
Mr Killilea has just joined us and has asked if the President-in-Office would perhaps respond to Question No 
Mr Verheugen I must once again ask you if you would be kind enough to answer Question No 
Question No by Mark Killilea H Subject Seals
In April Bord Iascaigh Mhara the Irish Sea Fisheries Board submitted a report to the European Commission on the physical interaction between grey seals and fishing gear
Research at two selected sites in Ireland over a year period produced conclusive evidence of damage to fish stocks by seals
This study is supported by extensive previous research
Can the Council inform me whether it has been made aware of this research by the Commission
Would it not agree that this report and others reveal that the extent of damage to fisheries by seals is very significant financially in local terms
Would it not also agree that measures to prevent such an impact would have to be considered justifiable particularly where a proven case existed
Would it be in support of the Commission financially assisting national fisheries organisations to carry out such studies in order to scientifically assess such a need
I would once again call on Mr Verheugen generosity and ask him to answer Mr Killilea question
Mr Killilea I will give you an answer
But I know in advance that you will see it as a non-answer because the Council has not received the report on the interaction between grey seals and fishing gear which is after all the report you are referring to
For this reason the Council cannot give its views on the report
But I have been informed Mr Killilea that you have addressed a similar question to the Commission
I believe the Commission is more likely to be in a position to give you a satisfactory answer
Mr President thank you for allowing my question and thanks to the President-in-Office for his answer even though he has stated that it is a non-answer
I received another non-answer from the Commission
I do not know where we stand
European taxpayers money was given to the Bord Iascaigh Mhara to do this research
The documentation and the serious scientific research has been in print since and it sits there gathering dust
I suspect Mr President-in-Office that we lack courage to tackle this major problem
But I want to point out to you that in the three sample cod catches on the west coast of Ireland % of the cod caught in the nets was either destroyed or severely damaged by the seals
Similarly with other species of white fish the overall figure was % of the total allowable catch of Irish fishermen destroyed by seals one way or another
It will take a lot of courage to stand up to the nonsense that goes on about those pretty animals
They may be pretty with their heads out of the water but they are not so pretty beneath the sea where they are devouring thousands of tonnes of very precious fish and food for the people of Europe
I say to the critics is it more important to feed the seals or to feed human beings
My opinion is that it is more important to feed human beings
I would like the President-in-Office to continue to put pressure on the Commission to have the moral courage to stand up to this awful situation which is staring us all in the face
Mr Killilea since I too have experience of the lengthy procedures in this House I fully understand your problem
I do not quite know whether I should support the seals the fish or the people
I would advise the Irish Government to bring the matter up again if as you say and I do not doubt your words it is important to the people of the west coast of Ireland
The Council cannot take the initiative to discuss a report by an Irish authority or to take a position when the report has not even been submitted to it
My advice would be if the Commission cannot give you an answer either that the Irish Government itself should raise this matter in Brussels
Thank you Mr Verheugen
That concludes Question Time
The sitting was suspended at pm and resumed at pm
Water policy
The next item is the report A by Mr White on behalf of the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Consumer Protection on the proposal and amended proposals for a Council Directive establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy C C and CSYN
I should like to say at the outset as I will be repeating through the evening that I shall have to be strict with regard to speaking time since we have a very tight schedule which will take us late into the night
Mr President I am very glad to be able to present my report on the water framework directive for this first reading
The path of this proposal has been almost as tortuous as a salmon swimming upstream
I should like to acknowledge the personal contribution of my colleague Mr Collins in the long haul that has finally brought us to this first reading
In Mr Collins chaired Parliament hearing on water policy that gave birth to the water framework directive
Perhaps we should call it the water baby and he will be heartened to see his baby at last christened by this Parliament before he leaves us later this year
I should like to pay tribute to the little puddle of water rapporteurs also present at the christening ceremony which include my colleagues Mr Florenz Mrs Schleicher Mr Eisma and Mr Collins himself who also has a water report
We have developed amongst us an esprit du corps whereby we have become water-minded and that is a very useful thing to have done
This proposal provides an historic opportunity to secure the Union most basic need for adequate supplies of good quality water for today and tomorrow generations
Its outcome will determine the future of the Union water resources well beyond the Millennium
Reform of the Union water policy is overdue and welcome
Piecemeal evolution has resulted in an incoherent body of legislation with differing and sometimes conflicting methods definitions and aims
The perilous state of much of the Union water resources is plain to see from the evidence provided to us by the Environment Agency in Copenhagen
The first report on Europe environment the so-called Dobris assessment sets out the problems in a clear manner and last year saw the publication of another assessment by the Environment Agency
Comparison of the two reports shows that progress still has to be made
The Dobris assessment reported that a quarter of Europe rivers are of poor or bad quality with either sparse populations of fish or completely devoid of fish
Last year assessment noted that there has been no overall improvement in river quality
There has not been any significant improvement in groundwater quality since the first assessment
Europe groundwater is endangered and polluted in several ways we are told
Problems include pollution by nitrates pesticides heavy metals and hydrocarbons leading to eutrophication toxic impacts in other parts of the water environment and possible effects upon human health
Moreover despite the numerous international agreements and many statements of good intent the implementation of Union water legislation remains poor
The Commission having taken part and I am grateful to them for that in the hearing which took place in produced its communication in February 
Following Parliament response to the communication a dialogue has been continuing between the Commission and myself
In that dialogue I voiced the concerns of the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Consumer Protection about the early proposal
The Commission is to be congratulated on its response in providing detailed annexes and basic definitions missing from the original
I am also heartened by the constructive attitude of the present German presidency
Before Parliament today there are compromise amendments dealing with important issues where in the spirit of the Amsterdam Treaty yet to be ratified I am pleased to present the results of a recent trialogue between myself the Commission and the Council
These compromise amendments show a new willingness to move towards the Environment Committee position on wetlands public participation marine monitoring and underground gas storage
This is and has had to be a complicated proposal It aims to promote a sustainable use of water resources
Member States will be obliged to achieve good status for all surface and ground waters by a set date
Good status means a healthy ecosystem and a low level of pollution
These targets will be achieved by river-basin management plans and backed up by Union-wide limits on pollution
The proposal sets out how Member States must identify river basins appoint river basin authorities and ensure that they produce plans
The plans will stipulate what must happen for good status to be achieved including pollution control promoting more efficient use of water regulating obstruction and introducing a charging system
My suggestions for the reform of the Commission proposal are designed to address the considerable problems which continue to undermine the implementation of Union water policy
At the same time my amendments seek to create a water policy framework which is both practical and ambitious
I urge that a tougher regime of pollution control is needed the goal for the longer term already contained in international conventions such as OSPAR HELCOM and Barcelona to which the EU and Member States are signatory is the eventual phasing out of toxic substances
In conclusion I should like to repeat the importance of the proposal before us
What can be more important to the future of the Community than secure and abundant supplies of healthy water
This is the first piece of Community water legislation to apply to all surface and ground waters
It bases the management of these waters firmly on the principle of sustainable development
Mr President water quality particularly in coastal waters is vitally important to the fisheries and aquaculture industries
The seas are generally the end recipients of pollutants emitted into the water particularly their coastal fringes which are vital for the reproduction of many species
The proposal for a directive directly affects those who live off these activities particularly as it will repeal two former directives one on fish waters and the other on shellfish waters
We have therefore tabled amendments in this respect
Amendment No extends the directive scope to include coastal areas and estuaries
This amendment falls within the context of recital a adopted by the Committee on the Environment and specifies that the Member States will have the option of taking into account pollution in coastal areas in order to assess its consequences on fishing activities
Amendments Nos and state that fishermen cannot be classified as users of water in the strict sense since their activity is not detrimental to this resource in quantitative or qualitative terms and since they are primarily the victims of any pollution
Finally Amendment No proposes support for the more vulnerable economic categories in particular the small aquaculture plants which must take measures to protect themselves against the pollution which they may cause
This would not involve tax exemption measures but rather support for filtration and purification equipment
Finally on behalf of the UPE Group I must express our support for the concept of management by river basin
This has demonstrated its worth in certain Member States and is the key issue in the Commission proposal
It must therefore be safeguarded
Mr President the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development calls on the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Consumer Protection as the committee responsible to incorporate the following conclusions in its report
Firstly the Agriculture Committee stresses that farmers use water for the benefit of consumers in general and that they are the first to be concerned about obtaining good water in order to ensure quality agricultural production
Secondly the committee acknowledges that in addition to the objectives of protecting water against degradation of aquatic ecosystems and the long-term conservation of water resources further steps need to be taken to reduce the adverse effects of floods and droughts
With specific regard to agriculture the committee rejects the idea of full cost recovery in respect of services provided for water as advocated in Article of the proposal for a directive However it does agree with the principle of amortising the costs of water services taking due account of the social environmental and economic consequences of amortisation and the geographical and climatic situation of the regions concerned
In particular the hydrological regime of the Mediterranean and southern areas of the European Union requires specific solutions in this respect
Without these and also without irrigation systems which often involve extremely high water storage and distribution costs it would be impossible to ensure the modernisation and long-term survival of these areas
Without a specific solution agriculture in the southern regions of Europe would not be able to survive in competition with the northern areas which have rain throughout the year
Fourthly the Agriculture Committee suggests with regard to the definitions and annexes that specific reference be made to bodies of water used for irrigators namely aqueducts and to the way in which their quality and quantity is to be assessed and also to irrigation farming as a distinct form of cyclical water use
Fifthly it proposes involving irrigators associations so that they can participate in the use and management of water basins and water in general
Finally as a Portuguese national I must stress the importance of establishing more stringent rules for the management of cross-border water basins in order to ensure basic quality levels and rates of flow of the water in these international rivers
Mr President the primary purpose of the framework directive on Community action on water policy is to ensure that every citizen has a right to good quality water both as something that sustains life and as something that exists in the environment
Water quality has been argued over a good deal however as pollution has been difficult to regulate
For this reason as a binding guarantee of people entitlement to good quality water provision must be made for the polluter pays principle effective monitoring to ensure that water is of good quality with the smallest number of exemptions possible and the examination of materials that harm water quality primarily from the health point of view
Negligence and irresponsible action can have disastrous and irreparable consequences
There is much that is good in this report so I would like to thank the rapporteur
It contains a particularly welcome amendment with Article a which provides for the monitoring of the implementation of the River Basin District Management Plan
The authorities in the Member States must be committed to better monitoring of water quality
However there is one problem with the report in my opinion which is to do with how water charges should be regulated
To my mind at least as far as Finland is concerned this is a matter of local democracy and the right of the local authorities to regulate charges and this should therefore not be interfered with
Special attention must be paid to groundwater
No-one should ever think that the situation is hopeless and that the water is so polluted that it is not worth doing anything about it
There are plenty of examples of problems being solved not perhaps returning water to its natural state but at least making it safe for humans
Mr President Commissioner representatives of the presidency of the Council the fact that we are discussing a framework directive today is thanks not least to Ian White
A few months ago the situation still looked quite different
The Commission wanted to present us with a communication at the time I was the rapporteur and together we ensured that we would achieve this result today in face of the rapid-fire decisions the Council wanted to take
That is in itself a success
As Members of this Parliament we must not forget that
The object of the directive is not as many of my colleagues believe especially Austrians that we want to regulate the ownership of water
Quite the contrary we want to protect the quality of water that is the purpose of the directive
Now it seems to me that the Council and the Commission want to propose that we should promise one another to protect the water but how we protect it should be left to the Member States to decide
I am not quite sure this is the right European approach
I am not in favour of issuing thousands of bans but I am in favour of issuing a few important bans and making them applicable throughout Europe
They need to have sound scientific backing
We decided to create the single market and one of the main objectives of the single market was to harmonise standards in the European Community not necessarily to make them exactly the same but to approximate them more closely
We seem to be moving away from that at present in environmental policy
You know what I am criticising
Unfortunately the directive on a framework for Community action in the field of water policy does not define Europe-wide quality standards and emission standards at least not the way the Council and the Commission formulate it although that is certainly what Parliament wants to do
I believe it is important to take this combined approach which we want to and will continue to pursue in future too
As someone who lives beside the Rhine my house and my farm are a few hundred metres from it I believe it is important that the local residents whoever they are make a start further up the river
If they do not make a start there if we Germans do not continue setting high standards our colleagues in the Netherlands will soon be drowning in dirty polluted water
This cannot after all be a matter for individual national policy-making we need European standards not hundreds of them but perhaps or 
I believe the Rhine the Rhone the Mosel need these European standards if we are to make any progress here in the future
The Council did not show any very serious commitment
We turned amendments into ten compromise amendments
So we have done a little better than the Council
The presidency of the Council has certainly achieved much in administrative terms
But in my view Parliament proposal was the better one
We believe that if we get what the Council wants we will find it complicated to regulate matters at national level and will end up with a Babylonian environment policy
Mr President the decision-making surrounding this water framework directive has certainly been a clumsy affair as a result of the informal political agreement that the Council reached without waiting for Parliament first reading
The enormous gulf between the substance of that agreement and what Parliament wanted reflected in over amendments forced Parliament and the Council to the highly unusual step of informal consultation something which is not yet provided for in the European Treaties though it may well be in future
Mr White has been our guide through this political jungle and I must congratulate him
He did a good job of defending Parliament views before the Council and succeeded in winning a number of points
He refused to succumb to pressure from the Member States on the points we feel are important such as the priority list and the combined approach
Despite the pressure of work and the complicated nature of the discussions he also managed to keep us all as up to date as possible
However it is now Parliament job to deliver a report at first reading clearly setting out how the quantity and quality of ground surface and coastal waters can best be protected
Strict definitions clear targets and transparent procedures are needed here
The Committee on the Environment has put forward some excellent proposals and I cannot understand why the Council is prepared to accept so few of them
It even has difficulty with amendments designed to ensure that environmental standards are met in line with other European directives such as the nitrates directive and with international conventions such as the OSPAR Convention
It is quite incomprehensible
I have no idea why the Council is against them
But we need not worry as the common position will not be dealt with in this parliamentary term and by the time the new parliamentary term begins the Amsterdam Treaty will have entered into force so the second reading will come under the codecision procedure
The Council will then have no choice but to take account of our views
I hope it realises how it cut off its own nose in concluding the informal political agreement and draws the relevant conclusions from this
Mr President I would like to thank the rapporteur for all his hard work on today report which takes account of the need for a more transparent framework directive that has a higher level of participation
As the rapporteur himself says echoing the concerns expressed in the Committee on the Environment one third of European rivers are polluted and coastal waters and groundwater are being overexploited It is therefore extremely difficult to obtain enough drinking water for the population
It will be even more difficult in the future particularly in some southern countries
That is why we are in favour of the proposal and why we were even more in favour of the previous proposal
For example Amendment No by Mr White was in our view an improvement as it was more complete
However we must work to ensure that there is a high level of participation in the river basin management plans in order to create a common transparent framework and to promote cross-border cooperation
Along with our Portuguese colleagues we visited the River Tagus and we realised that the Portuguese were anxious to ensure that Spain made good use of its resources That will be the only way of guaranteeing cross-border cooperation between our two countries
Mr President I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his tremendous work
These proposals are very welcome indeed because they attempt to establish an integrated approach to water management and protection which are very important
The underlying basis of all of this the polluter pays principle is one that we should be pushing most of all here
However the terms of the analysis that has been carried out must be broadened to consider the very important social consequences of what is essentially a unique social service
The provision of water for domestic needs as a necessity of daily life for economic needs and for farming and other activities must be guaranteed
I would refer Members in particular to Amendment No dealing with Article which provides that there will not be universal charges for water where special social and other conditions apply
These distinctions are important and in particular we must ensure the continued free service for those who most need it
Mr President in discussing the water framework directive tonight we are unfortunately talking not about water protection but about a piecemeal policy
The proposal makes that clear
There are too many exceptions no clear limit values and standards quality targets that are in no way binding that follow the English principle of let water it down and nobody will notice
Then there are the excessively long transition periods of up to years which make it clear that water protection is basically being postponed to some never-never day
That makes a mockery of consumer protection
But for me the worst of all the ecological Waterloo is the question of the discharge of hazardous substances
In spite of the OSPAR convention this quasi-common position proposes that nothing nothing at all should be done
I believe we must realise that water is too precious a resource to be used as a rubbish dump
In that regard I expect us to give a very clear signal during the vote tomorrow
I also hope that we will reach agreement tomorrow on setting limit values for radioactivity as we did in the case of the drinking water directive 
The President cut the speaker off
Mr President in my autonomous community of Aragon we believe that our future depends on water
We also believe that it is not that there is too much water in our territory but that we are lacking the investment needed to use and make the most of what there is
We are very aware of the fact that without water there can be no development It is essential in order to preserve the environment and to generate wealth and employment in both the agricultural and industrial sectors
Our problem is not the quality of water but the quantity of water in other words its scarcity
It is therefore almost an insult to us that the River Ebro the largest river in the Iberian Peninsula flows through Aragon for kilometres part of which is desert yet we scarcely make any use of its considerable volume This is mainly because of the Spanish Government historical lack of investment
In fact it is precisely because of this lack of investment that some might say that there is an excess of water and thus justify transfers to other more developed areas We therefore believe that it is extremely important to prevent these policies of transferring water between basins
Far from balancing the region in practice they actually heighten the imbalance and lead to further depopulation This is because the work involved is costly and it almost always harms the environment
Moreover it does not guarantee sustainable development with an unlimited supply Indeed these transfers are merely the reflection of a policy where the strongest asserts its power over the weakest
Tomorrow we will vote on various amendments that have already been approved in committee They aim to limit inter-basin transfers to very specific situations where prior authorisation has been granted
It must also be demonstrated that the basins receiving the supply have taken all possible measures to reduce demand In our opinion this is the appropriate path to follow so as to ensure that our water policy is an effective instrument for European social and territorial cohesion
Mr President I would like to point out the differences that exist in some respects between the position of the Spanish Socialists and that of our political group
We fully support the idea of a framework directive for the Community water policy and we very much welcome the proposal for a directive
However these legislative attempts to harmonise policies may become something of a farce if we disregard Europe special territorial characteristics
The issue of water in countries with sufficient rain cannot be dealt with in the same way as it is in other countries such as my own where water is a very scarce commodity
We cannot treat countries that are used to floods and droughts such as the Mediterranean countries in the same way as northern countries
We believe that it would be very unfair for instance to impose the strict obligation to recover full water costs This generalisation would mean that a Spanish citizen or farmer would pay between and times more for water than British or Belgian citizens for example
Other amendments refer to situations involving infringements some of which are impossible to resolve in certain southern regions and to the requirements for transfers and the recharge of aquifers They are all following the same line of thought
Parliament has legislative power that can be used on the basis of scientific and balanced criteria However it should not be used to try to make the various European regions seem the same particularly given the differences that exist in terms of the quantity quality and pattern of their rainfall
Mr President I fully agree with the speech just made by my colleague Mr Aparicio It is clear that we must not forget the idea of unity in diversity nor the fact that proactive measures can cost us dear
We must therefore remember that Spain water problem is a strategic one as you are well aware Commissioner
Amendments have been tabled in this respect and I hope that the Commission takes account of them and excludes cases of serious drought or flooding from the directive requirements This is a factor that must be considered
The directive must also allow Spain to build links between basins that are adequately balanced as provided for in the National Hydrological Plan
It is only in this way that we can guarantee supply for the southern parts of our country
We also need to adapt the principle of recovering full costs
We cannot add further difficulties on top of those that some countries are already faced with We must avoid making the cost of water in countries with less water so expensive that individuals and multiple users cannot afford it
I cannot support many of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment in this case as they are unreasonable
There are some things that do work such as the interregional agreements between neighbouring countries I therefore do not see why we need to have agreements on international river basin districts when these agreements are already working well
We should restrict this to consultation with the Commission on the initiative of the Member States if a problem arises so that it can resolve it and act as arbitrator as it always does
As regards the quantitative aspects I am very concerned at some of the amendments tabled regarding transfers and the recharge of aquifers
This is standard practice in Spain and it allows us to derive much more benefit from our scarce resources
These are mere quantitative issues which moreover would prevent this directive from being approved
Mr President Commissioner I would also like to begin by congratulating the Commission and Mr White on the proposal and expressing my support for it
However I would like to look at two issues that are the product of neo-liberal fundamentalism and the democratic deficit in the European Union
As far as neo-liberal fundamentalism is concerned the desire to recover the full costs of water use is a comparative insult to Spain as was pointed out by Mr Cunha Mr Aparicio and other speakers
It would be particularly bad for regions such as Murcia Andalusia Aragon and so on where it would have serious consequences
As regards the democratic deficit I think it is important to consider involving the communities of irrigators such as the Tribunal de las Aguas and the Consejo de Hombres Buenos which in some cases such as in Valencia or in Murcia have been working for over a thousand years It is essential to ensure that there is democracy in this field too
Mr President the framework directive that we are discussing today and voting on tomorrow will be a breakthrough in the European management of water quality and quantity
But it will be more than just that
It is also the crowning glory of all the tireless hard work done by some of our colleagues
Let me mention here Karl-Heinz Florenz who initiated and championed our cause my Dutch colleague Doeke Eisma and of course the rapporteur Mr White whom I congratulate on his report and on the compromise amendments that should enable us to achieve a large majority tomorrow
The water framework directive is the only correct response to our hitherto fragmentary inefficient and inadequate policy on water quality and the total absence of a policy on water quantity
Water plays a supremely important role in the lives of Dutch people
In one of our folk songs we sing about Limburg as where the broad Meuse flows majestically to the sea and the Zeelanders motto luctor et emergo I struggle and I emerge refers to their struggle with the sea which after the disastrous floods eventually led to the Delta works a dam that brought us worldwide fame
We also reclaimed land in the Flevo polder
We struggle with water on a daily basis in the Netherlands in the polders the delta where the Meuse the Rhine and the Scheldt flow into the sea
Anyone who dares to claim that we with our well-organised Dutch water management system can solve the water quantity problem ourselves has only to look at the floods that have overwhelmed us in recent years
Mr President I have just three points to make
Firstly I support a water policy which promotes the rational use of water by encouraging rational control of its demand and discouraging irrational increases in its supply
Secondly I would stress that river basins form the basic unit for surface water and groundwater management These river basins do not stop at national borders they always run from source to mouth no matter what countries may lie in between
Finally I must emphasise the understanding and collaboration achieved within our group between the Spanish and Portuguese Members
This recently led to the preparation of a water manifesto considered in this report and which is particularly symbolic as because of our group it involved Members of both these nationalities
Although we can be pleased with this motion for a resolution the same is not true of the agreement on common rivers signed between the two governments In this case Community solidarity must be shown and cooperation between the Member States is called for
Mr President this directive had a difficult birth
On behalf of our colleagues let me after the event thank all those who played a constructive part in the work including of course our rapporteur Mr White but also the Commission which has showed signs of flexibility
I expect the German Presidency to scrutinise Parliament work carefully otherwise there could be a bad surprise in store for it at the second reading in the European Parliament in the form of rejection
As rapporteur on the groundwater action programme which is another extremely important area I regard the following requirement as essential to lay down comprehensive groundwater protection measures ban direct discharges of harmful substances and linked to that not to lay down limit values for groundwater to preempt what is called the watering down effect and finally to remove and prevent where possible what are called indirect discharges into groundwater and of course to clean up polluted groundwater as far as possible by technical means
Three of my amendments serve those goals
Let me point out again that I am particularly concerned with Amendment No and do not accept the compromise amendment
I would warn against making exaggerated unrealistic and impractical demands
Even if environmental protection has in the past had a raw deal in many other policy areas and too little attention has been paid to it we must not repeat the same mistake by going too far in the opposite direction
That is why I and my group are firmly opposed to certain amendments some of which are simply not feasible either for financial reasons or because we do not have the available technical resources
Legislation that called for too much would not be credible
Let me conclude with a question to the Commission What is happening with the draft directive on ecological water quality
If the Commission has officially withdrawn that proposal I am not aware of it
Mr President Commissioner in line with Parliament wishes this report introduces very important innovations in regard to protecting what is perhaps Europe most valuable asset water
It clarifies and enshrines the combined approach enshrines across-the-board water protection and sets ambitious quality targets for groundwater
For many Member States the combined approach represents a real quantum leap in terms of clean water
It is high time to rethink our approach Europe-wide
We do not have the right mercilessly to pollute and poison the rivers and seas instead we have an obligation first of all to clean up all waste water including industrial effluents to the best of our technical ability and then to divert it
We need strict emission standards not just discharge standards
I regard the attempts to enshrine water resource management in the directive in quantitative terms as negative so I am very glad that the legal services of both the Council and the Commission take the view that enshrining it in this way is not compatible with the legal basis envisaged for the adoption of the directive
I am also glad that I have already managed to get an amendment through in the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Consumer Protection that specifies quite clearly the kind of supranational authority that needs to be created
A Member State right to manage its water resources cannot possibly be restricted
If that is decided tomorrow I will be happy to vote for the report on which I warmly congratulate Mr White
Mr President the ample supply of good quality water is a basic need of the Community
Problems have been discovered both in the quality of the water in the rivers and with water being wasted in urban and industrial areas
Water resources in the different European states do not constitute the common property of Europe as with any other natural resources which are used for trade
Each Member State however must as a nation become involved in improving the water quality of its own rivers in developing and implementing action to save water and in protecting its groundwater
The idea of a common water policy should be made a reality through measures to protect areas of water that are shared by neighbouring countries and those affecting different states
Recently the condition of the Baltic Sea has deteriorated because untreated waste water has been pumped into it
Efforts must be made to prevent environmental disasters such as these in accordance with northern dimension policy and those responsible for the Community water policy should also be involved
The northern dimension will provide staunch support for this as it does for other projects aimed at protecting the environment
The desire is expressed in the proposal to introduce certain quality standards for water consumed in the European Community
It is good policy to incorporate such elements in a common policy as long as we remember to leave sufficient scope for solutions to be found which correspond to specific national conditions
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I am the last speaker in this debate on water and since the problem is being looked at from the point of view of quantity rather than quality I shall allow myself to take certain liberties
I will try not to repeat what has already been said by my Spanish and Portuguese colleagues and will talk about something that is not contained in this report
I should merely like to put forward a specific argument regarding the issue of costs
We reject the initial proposal presented by the Commission that the full cost of water services such as infrastructures should be recovered from the users who are mainly farmers We also reject the proposal that the costs must be taken into account since this could ruin the already fragile agriculture in the south
We need to look at the technical improvements that are possible in industrial processes taking account of the cost-effectiveness ratio as well as the situation in the sector
We must abide by the political agreement reached by the Council of Ministers in June
We must look at eliminating hazardous substances and the environmental objectives we want to achieve in the light of the actual technical and economic possibilities open to us
We nevertheless agree with the proposal to make an exception in cases of drought Indeed it is very important that an exception be granted for both droughts and floods
As far as the international river basin districts are concerned I believe that the principle of subsidiarity should be applied An agreement has already been reached with Portugal which is responsible for our neighbouring basins
As regards the quantitative aspects the conditions for transfers and the recharge of aquifers the proposal offers no legal basis The Treaty requires unanimity in this area and we are therefore not going to support this at the moment
As far as the amendments I tabled are concerned I would only say that three relate to definitions that have not been taken into account such as the mass of artificial water 
The President cut the speaker off
Mr President I would like to begin by thanking the Committee on the Environment and its rapporteur Mr White for their thorough consideration of the new proposal for a framework directive on water resources
As has been emphasised Parliament has taken the reform of water policy very seriously and I would like to take this opportunity to praise the substantial and very positive influence which Parliament has had both with regard to starting the reform and developing it further
The Commission proposal on the treatment of dangerous substances and Annex V on ecological status are largely based on Parliament constructive involvement
The same constructive involvement lay behind the recent informal talks between Parliament the Council and the Commission and as Mr Eisma pointed out this was largely an innovation
On the whole the results of these talks further improved the text while they also brought the views of the two legislative institutions closer together
This is a positive development and I can of course endorse the outcome which appears in the form of Compromise Amendments Nos to 
In fact most of Parliament amendments improve the technical quality and make the text clearer and I am very pleased to be able to say that we endorse the thinking behind most of them
We can in principle accept of the amendments in full or in part
The Commission is also able to endorse a number of the other amendments We support Parliament initiatives with regard to the treatment of dangerous substances openness the combined approach and the inclusion of radioactivity
As you can see Mr President there are a great number of amendments and it would be impossible for me to go through them all in a reasonable period of time
I shall therefore confine myself to mentioning some of the main areas
Firstly there is the treatment of dangerous substances
This is a major problem on which the report rightly focuses
It is important for us to be consistent with our obligations within international organisations in terms of discharges
However a lack of information about the social and economic consequences means that it is not always appropriate to introduce legally binding requirements at the present time
We therefore intend to accept the principle behind Amendments Nos and and in Article of the proposal of introducing a reference to elimination as a final goal
This is in line with the approach in the declaration of the North Sea Conference and all the relevant maritime conventions
The other amendments on this subject ie Amendments Nos and are therefore rejected
As far as openness and involving the public are concerned the discussions between the Council and Parliament have been particularly productive
The Commission can fully endorse the rapporteur compromise amendment which reflects the agreements reached concerning public inquiries or consultation and both the Council and the Commission reporting
Amendments Nos and concern the need to define the combined approach which the Commission accepts in principle although we are proposing a slightly different wording in order to make the scope more precise in legal terms
The Commission is also able to accept in principle Amendments Nos and which call for a timetable for the Commission to introduce controls for priority substances
However Amendments Nos and on reviewing the priority list do not allow sufficient time to deal with the substances The Commission is therefore rejecting these amendments and is proposing to keep the existing review period of six years
The Commission accepts in principle Amendments and concerning the inclusion of radioactivity in the proposal although they may require some rewording
With regard to charges which have featured strongly in the debate here this evening a more complete integration of environmental and resource costs is essential but the problem needs to be looked at more closely
Amendments Nos and therefore cannot be accepted at the moment
However Amendment No which calls for charges to be set at a level which encourages the attainment of environmental objectives is very helpful and can of course be accepted
Then there are a number of amendments which the Commission is rejecting for technical reasons
There are also some which we are rejecting in the form in which they are presented but which contain many elements which we think can be included in the amended proposal
I shall refrain from mentioning all of these
In conclusion I can only welcome this report and the same applies to the progress which has already been made
Parliament has played a significant role and the constructive approach which has been expressed in the discussions provides the basis for a good working atmosphere at future negotiations
In connection with such an important subject it is clear that a number of issues will require in-depth discussion before they can be resolved
I am convinced that the firm stance adopted by Parliament as the legislative process has progressed will help us to achieve our goal which is a water policy we can be proud of
Let me just add on the question raised by Mrs Schleicher that in our view the proposal concerning ecological water quality is contained within this proposal and is therefore now redundant
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at am
Deliberate release of GMOs
The next item is the report A by Mr Bowe on behalf of the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Consumer Protection on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Directive EEC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms CCOD
Mr President scientific knowledge is very often shaky when it comes to almost all issues of general environmental interest
Various research institutes produce ever-changing data which are used as a basis for political decision-making and which may be interpreted whichever way is desirable
Painting a threatening picture is often the easiest option
Excessive restrictions on research shift the responsibility onto the shoulders of others while the Union sneaks along behind like a stowaway
But then regulation is an unconditional prerequisite and this is indeed a very sensitive area of research
It is the choice of the consumers themselves which products they wish to consume
Their choice is informed by factors that have to be respected factors based on knowledge just as much as feelings
For this reason goods must be labelled clearly comprehensibly and uniformly
There must be an attempt to increase consumer awareness of the benefits and possible risks of genetically modified products
To achieve this objective we have to invest time and money in publishing the work of the research institutes in a language that everyone can understand giving the consumer the chance to take part in the lobbying process
To gain consumer confidence we have to observe the precautionary principle
As our experience and scientific knowledge grows the content of the directive will naturally have to be reappraised
There would have to be a thorough evaluation of the risks involved and that would have to extend to an assessment of possible delayed effects
Farmers cannot be assumed to have sufficient knowledge to bear any responsibility but developers and manufacturers of genetically modified products having conducted the appropriate tests will have full responsibility for any harm resulting from the release of any product whether into the environment or for human consumption
Mr President the Committee on the Environment originally called for the introduction of a European moratorium to give us time to reflect
The Council rejected the idea but that does not mean there is anything wrong with it
On the one hand we have so much scientific uncertainty and on the other there is a rather dubious decision-making procedure for individual applications to place products on the market so there would have been grounds to call a halt and even the Commission influence has lacked direction
There is uncertainty in particular regarding the question of ethics the benefits to society and the long-term consequences for the environment and health
We should not have GMOs containing antibiotics or resistant genes or GMOs which can cross-pollinate with their cousins in the wild
The Commission proposal tightens up the procedures in many ways
This applies to the common principles for environmental risk assessment obligatory monitoring of products placed on the market and limiting the period on the market to seven years This is all very good
It provides the right basis for the approval of genetically modified organisms a basis which I think should apply to the approval of all GMO products
But the same proposal will exclude products covered by other Community legislation in such a way that there will only be an environmental risk assessment
This could lead to GMO products evading the thorough controls time limits and evaluation proposed in this directive
I am also concerned about the new simplified procedures which make it easier to release or market certain GMOs
This is a problem because the basis we have for making such decisions is too small
Our experience is too limited and too uncertain in the area of GMOs
The technology is so new that restricted authorisation would enable the authorities to have better control
Let me say this from the point of view of the PPE I hope that what I just heard Mrs Jensen say is not the point of view of the entire PSE Group for that would mean the talks we have been holding over the past weeks were not very constructive
But I believe we will manage to agree on many points during the vote tomorrow
I particularly thank the rapporteur David Bowe for going to such great trouble with this report for always being open to discussion and also being very pragmatic and determined even if we do not agree on every point
I hope therefore that we will manage to adopt the report tomorrow on the basis of a very broad consensus
What is the PPE Group standpoint
We want safety for man and the environment but we do not want more red tape
I believe it is a big mistake to believe that more and more red tape will protect man and the environment from harmful effects
We need clear rules that match up to the risk
If we bear that in mind as we in the PPE Group do then we could say there is both good and bad in the Commission proposal
And there is both good and bad in the report from the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Consumer Protection
In the Commission proposal we particularly welcome the improved labelling provisions compared with those in the original directive and we welcome the fact that the Committee on the Environment has improved them again
We particularly welcome the fact that the Commission has opted for the simplified procedure
We also welcome the fact that provision is made for at least a rudimentary majority-state procedure
What is very negative about the Commission proposal is that it lays down that consent shall generally be granted for a fixed period of years
Let me ask the Commissioner what is the scientific basis for these years
What risks arise after precisely years
Do they occur after years for all GMOs
Why not after or years why not after or years
We are in favour of the approach that has become established in pharmaceutical law
If there is a risk then the consent must be withdrawn at once without waiting until the seventh year
If there is no risk then there is no need for a time limit
So we are very much against any general time limit
We agree with the Committee on the Environment proposal to make this a discretionary rather than a fixed provision
I would prefer to be even more specific here
That is why we have tabled an amendment
We want time-limits to be the exception justified on scientific grounds
But the Committee on the Environment is moving in the right direction here
On another question the committee is moving in the wrong direction
I listed a number of points in the preliminary discussions
One important point we are discussing again tonight is the question of socio-economic criteria
I believe that you are giving the Americans a through ball here
If we make authorisation conditional on socio-economic criteria we will be taken for a ride at the WTO
Then we will not have a chance to gain the support of any panel in this area
For that reason alone we should not take that decision
The PPE Group decision at the final vote will depend on whether the disputed points which we have also raised in committee are properly clarified and agreed
I hope we will all be able to vote for the report tomorrow and thereby send out a good signal for biotechnology in Europe
Mr President the report we are now debating is one of the more sensitive ones before Parliament
It contains genuine conflicts between European industry and its desire to catch up with the USA and the more cautious environmental approach expressed through the application of the precautionary principle
I believe that this really is an area where the precautionary principle should be applied in practice not of course as a rejection of GMOs nor in the form of slow handling of the matter by the authorities but as a cautious approach to the subject
In my view a great deal can be achieved through open discussion not least with interested citizens without of course revealing commercial secrets and through careful and preferably rapid handling by the authorities
Like other groups the Liberal Group is divided in its attitude towards both the Commission proposal and the amendments
I personally belong to the group which supports the Commission seven-year rule but not the simplified procedure although a simplified procedure could become a possibility if we considered a renewal of the marketing authorisation for the products in other words extending the seven years
Nor am I a supporter of creating a multinational application procedure at this time
One of the problems in connection with the complex procedure is that decisions are made through a committee procedure in which Parliament has no influence
We have seen in the past that this creates conflicts later on and it would therefore be desirable if the process could begin now
We hope it will be possible to find some form of sensible compromise tomorrow in my view preferably with as tight a timetable as possible
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen genetically modified organisms can be regarded as the latest food scare
In my opinion every effort is being made to fuel these scares even down to the terms used
GMOs should actually be called GIOs genetically improved organisms as they are being created to substantially improve quality
The words deliberate release in the directive title imply a deliberately committed offence However this phrase actually means placing the organisms or their products on the market only after very strict controls have been carried out and after carefully considered consent has been given for the experimental cultivation of these products
These food scares are forcing the political decision-makers to hide behind the sacrosanct precautionary principle which if comprehensively applied would prevent any scientific progress Yet this progress is demanded by those who want their comfort improved and their ills cured
As a surgeon this principle would have prevented me from getting anywhere near a scalpel
We really should not be using this word of the moment ethics for anything and everything as it has a very specific meaning and can be better replaced in most cases by a much more appropriate term
As for including in this directive the medicinal products already covered by another directive as indicated by Amendment No which aims to delete the excellent Article this would strike a fatal blow to research on new medicines which are desperately needed to treat new and serious illnesses
To conclude we must make certain requests
Firstly a full information package must be provided before any consent is granted to the placing of GMOs or their products on the market
Secondly there must be a rigorous labelling policy
Thirdly traceability and monitoring must be guaranteed together with a detailed assessment of the risks and benefits involved rather than using the precautionary principle at each stage
Producers must be held liable for any damage to people or property and the placing of these products on the market must naturally be halted in the event of an alarm
We should authorise the cultivation of GMOs to be marketed within the European Union to prevent our Member States from being penalised and other countries enjoying an advantage such as the United States which produces and consumes genetically modified products and these are increasingly invading our supermarkets and will continue to do so
Clearly we must continue to ensure that these products do not constitute a risk to human health or the environment by taking account of the periodic opinions of appropriate and competent scientific committees
Mr President since when the current directive was adopted the situation involving GMOs and their release has changed significantly
Firstly scientific uncertainty about the nature and extent of the risks is increasing
Secondly for certain categories of GMOs there is proof that serious or irreversible risks do exist
Thirdly and with all due respect to Mr Cabrol the precautionary principle has acquired legal and political status and has become a basic principle of European legislation
The directive must therefore be adapted to this new situation
The Commission proposal does not take this into consideration
Instead it aims to accelerate the consent procedures and facilitate international trade
The adoption of a simplified procedure for placing new GMOs on the market cannot be justified on the basis of a claimed equivalence with existing GMOs
This concept of equivalence does not have any serious scientific basis
In fact this simplified procedure opens the door to the mutual recognition of standards allowing products authorised in the United States to be imported into Europe in increasing numbers
We therefore feel that certain categories of GMOs that constitute particularly serious risks to the environment or health should be destroyed not released
This relates in particular to those GMOs that contain antibiotic-resistant genes those that release toxins that are harmful to the useful fauna and those that are likely to cross-breed with related wild or cultivated species
We have tabled eight basic amendments which we hope will be adopted by the House
Our group vote depends on the fate of these amendments
Mr President it is claimed that the world food production will struggle without genetic modification but I have serious reservations about this statement when I compare it with the story about the terminator gene
By making seed infertile western firms are making developing countries dependent on their grain supplies thus perpetuating the unfair distribution of food even with genetically modified organisms
This example shows that our debate on GMOs must look at more than just the long-term effects on consumer health and safety
We would be missing the really central issues because what we are dealing with here is an ethical problem
I believe that God created reality and I therefore reject the simple reduction of plants and animals to production factors to be manipulated
As humans we are not masters but stewards and this is the principle on which we should base our position on the introduction of GMOs
In practical terms this means that we must strictly enforce the precautionary principle as the rapporteur rightly points out
From an ethical point of view I am wholeheartedly in favour of this
In the Committee on the Environment I tried to put forward amendments to extend the risk assessment to include ethical aspects but unfortunately there was not enough support for this
Fortunately there are proposals from the rapporteur which give people with ethical objections the freedom to choose GMO-free products
I think it is highly desirable for GMOs to be traceable through clear labelling and the preservation of GMO-free production chains
Mr President there is a proverb from the Ladin hills not far from your own home area that goes Qui va prudan va sicur e lontan 
It means he who goes cautiously goes safely and goes far
I believe it is a proverb that the rapporteur whom I thank for his work has borne in mind in his proposals
He has made the Commission proposal more precise careful and safer in a number of areas
I believe it is indeed necessary to take that approach in a field in which we do not yet have the necessary experience
I do not have the time to go into every individual point so I will only comment on a few that I regard as most important
I think it is most important that the precautionary principle is specifically enshrined
In my opinion now that it is enshrined in the Amsterdam Treaty we should do so in all legislation
I also consider it most important that Parliament proposal makes greater provision for information for involvement of the public
It is also most important to ensure that genetically modified products and organisms can be identified to make it easier to recover them and also to assess the risk
Risk evaluation of long-term effects has been enshrined as has the possibility for Member States to set additional requirements for environmentally sensitive areas
I also consider it most important and here I would second the rapporteur question to the Commissioner for consent to be limited rather than unlimited
There are other areas of environmental legislation where we find that unlimited authorisation has been granted for plant and then at a time when we already have quite different legislation that plant can go on operating under the old limit values for a long time and does not have to adapt to new technology
So I believe it is necessary to set limits
But I would also have liked to ask the Commissioner whether seven years is the right period or whether there could not be a different more appropriate number
For it is important when we inform the people to be able to tell them why a particular decision was taken rather than another one
I hope Members will endorse the Environment Committee proposals at the vote tomorrow so that we can present the Council with a proposal that takes account of what this Parliament stands for namely concern for the citizens of Europe
Mr President we cannot forget that this proposal amends a previous proposal and that the Member States and the Commission itself therefore already have a great deal of experience with it
As a result we should welcome some of the proposals that improve on previous provisions such as the introduction of a mandatory post-marketing monitoring system for products the introduction of clear risk assessment criteria the classification of the experimental releases of products an improvement in administrative procedures and increased transparency throughout the process
These are all improvements and I therefore find it difficult to understand many of the amendments that have been tabled in the Committee on the Environment They seem to reflect an excessive desire for control
Biotechnology in general and genetic manipulation techniques provide great hope for humanity They are not a threat and we must get that message across to the whole of society
We must also get rid of the whole unscientific mentality surrounding this issue
We must not allow fundamentalist political ideas to hide behind the cloak of ethical objections
We cannot forget that the patent laws already take account of the ethical dimension and public policy before a patent is granted In addition we have always rejected socio-economic criteria when approving the release of any product onto the market
This is political pro-activism pure and simple
I therefore clearly support the main points of the Commission balanced proposal although I will vote against many of the amendments that have been tabled
Mr President I welcome very much the tightening that this new directive represents
It confronts a number of important issues as does the report by Mr Bowe
However it misses one major strategic point and that arises from the fact that European citizens are very much more concerned about GMOs and their potential effects than other populations particularly in North America
What is missing from the recommendations here and the directive is the provisions for Member States to apply moratoria that are not necessarily based on strict existing scientific opinion
What I would want to see certainly in the second reading of this directive is provision for Member States at least to put forward moratoria for five years while that research is taking place
Mr President thank you for the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate
Genetic research has much to offer mankind in alleviating disease enhancing food security and quality and in the area of environmental protection
Understandably there have been many concerns raised in relation to this new and developing science They include lack of product labelling environmental effects antibiotic markers used in the selection process along with ethical moral and social considerations
These issues need debating and both consumers and public are right to be cautious
On the question of food safety I repeat my view that only after the most stringent tests should genetically modified food or food ingredients be allowed into the food chain and only then with detailed consumer information
The consumer must be given a clear choice at all times
It would be wrong however to deprive agriculture of the benefits of modern research
To do so would tie the hands of the industry at a time when for example my country Ireland as an agricultural exporting nation must become increasingly competitive
The selective use of genetic research would assist in developing my country green image and lead to a reduction in the use of fertilizers and pesticides
Mr President I was very glad that Mr Bowe accepted our proposals regarding liability
But I hope I have no grounds for mistrust after hearing Mr Liese statement and hearing about his preliminary talks
I hope we do not drop the idea of the insurance certificate for otherwise liability would be pointless
People would think we were mad if we said tomorrow that drivers were allowed to take their cars on the road without an insurance certificate
It would be even more senseless in the case of a risk technology to call only for liability without making it compulsory to have insurance
I hope that tomorrow vote will be the proof indeed the acid test that the European Parliament can assume responsibility
I was also pleased by the call just now for Member States to be able to apply moratoria
We tabled an amendment to precisely that effect in the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Consumer Protection but unfortunately it was in vain
We hope you will be able to approve it tomorrow
I hope tomorrow we will send out a signal that we take the alarming scientific findings seriously
A simplified procedure is irresponsible as is Category I and the majority-state procedure
But what I regard as the ultimate irresponsibility is ayear consent period for doubtful cases
That is pure cynicism for surely it means that we are using man and nature as a form of guinea-pig
We believe it is vital to ban antibiotic-resistant genes for otherwise we are heading for a therapeutic disaster and to ensure that high-risk plants ie those that can cross over to others really must not be allowed to spread 
The President cut the speaker off
Mr President the applications of genetically modified organisms are very broadly based and can be found in significant areas of human life from medicine and the protection of the environment to agriculture and foodstuffs
However it is natural for the citizen to ask how we can ensure that the explosive pace at which this phenomenon is evolving does not exceed our capacity to regulate the issues that arise while at the same time ignoring the safety of our society and our eco-systems
Taking all these factors into account the Community issued Commission Directive EEC which was implemented for the first time in 
However experience necessitated that it be revised
Today we have before us a report which seeks to revise the directive and I should like to thank our rapporteur Mr Bowe for the tremendous work he has put into this report
By tabling my amendments I wished to clarify the relationship that exists between humans and GMOs and this because the definition of such organisms in the Commission text is formulated in such a way as to include humans
Amendments Nos and which I have tabled help to clarify this point and permit the use of human genes in the transfer and creation of GMOs
In this way we can produce useful substances such as human insulin and many other human bio-molecules
In my second amendment I have ruled out human beings as recipients of GMOs which would have led to the creation of genetically modified humans and this would not have been acceptable for scientific ethical social and legal reasons
We must wake up to the fact that GMOs and biotechnology are neither an economic nor a universal panacea but nor are they a Pandora box
This is indeed a force a force which opens up wonderful opportunities if we use it prudently and responsibly
It offers us the opportunity to combat far more effectively catastrophes on a global scale which all types of polluting activity inflicts on the environment
It offers us the opportunity to combat the misery that disease inflicts on human beings and the wretchedness wrought on society by famine
Mr President I can think of a number of basic requirements in relation to GMOs
First of all there is a stronger requirement for food to be wholesome
People are becoming more aware and this is leading to discussions concerning antibiotics salmonella and additives
Secondly consumers should be able to make an informed choice and labelling would enable them to do this
Such a requirement is absolutely crucial
Thirdly the ethical and environmental implications should be explained and there should be a ban on crops which have been made resistant to pesticides
Fourthly there should be rules at both European and international level governing the safety precautions that are required should GMOs be released into the environment
Clearly there has to be a deadline for drawing up these rules as well as rules relating to producer responsibility
Finally the Member States should be entitled to impose their own stricter rules and to adopt more progressive measures for example moratoriums
Mr President I welcome the Bowe report and congratulate the rapporteur who has put an enormous amount of work into this
It is obviously very important that we put in place legislation that the people of Europe will have confidence in
I am one of those who regard advances in genetic modification as having enormous potential benefits for mankind
However in recent months and years the voices of those calling for caution have got louder than those pointing out the advantages
Of course politicians should never simply react to the loudest lobby but public concern about GMOs has grown to such an extent that it is now very difficult to find farmers in my country who are prepared to have these trial crops grown on their land
Unfortunately for the scientists engaged in GMO research the public have heard relatively little about the benefits of GMO technology and a lot about the potential disadvantages
This is a defect of the debate that scientists still have to put right in the public arena
The directive before us is on the right lines and we believe broadly strikes the right balance between the freedom of the scientists to innovate and market the product of their innovation and the right of public authorities to insist on safety
I agree with Mr Liese that the seven-year authorisation period is unsatisfactorily arbitrary
If there is doubt about any genetically modified material then surely it should not be permitted for release in the first place
There are however certain amendments for example Amendment No which call for more caution and which we British Conservatives want to support
In this we shall be taking up the recent call of our party leader in the House of Commons where he spoke in favour of a three-year moratorium on the commercial release of genetically modified crops until more research is done into the consequences of such releases especially for biological diversity
Curiously the British Government which Mr Bowe unfortunately does not adorn has ignored the advice of its own nature protection body English Nature by refusing to agree to such a moratorium
More curiously still Mr Bowe and Mr Collins we suspect were on the brink of supporting such a moratorium before their voices were stayed by a telephone call from London
Such is the fate of principle in the New British Labour Party
Mr President I wish to make a personal statement under Rule 
I listened carefully to what other colleagues said with regard to the issue of a moratorium
I should say first of all that the chairman of the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Consumer Protection and I as the rapporteur signed a request to the Commission to consider the possibility of some kind of moratorium until the new proposal we are debating today was brought into place and the appropriate safeguards introduced
However there has been a reference to a moratorium in the amendments by Mrs Breyer on behalf of the Green Group
I hope that somebody can identify for me in the eight amendments tabled by Mrs Breyer the one which calls for a moratorium
It seems to me that none of them do and I do not understand why she says there is one because that is simply not the case
Finally I would just say this I was very surprised by Mrs Breyer remarks describing the maximum time limit of years as something awful because Amendment No by her own group itself requires a maximum time limit of years
Mr President on theyear question the committee called for ayear time-limit where there are safety doubts
I am surprised to hear Mr Liese applauding for it would be cynical of me to say I shall put products on the market which I know in advance are doubtful
That would be turning man and nature into guinea-pigs
What we would have liked to see are monitoring programmes before the seven years are up ie a fixed time-limit but with monitoring programmes that start before that date
We tabled several other amendments in the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Consumer Protection doing so in three different ways in regard to the moratorium for release
The Group of the Party of European Socialists rejected them
We have now tabled Amendment No which reverses the burden of proof by saying that the Commission must provide proof to the contrary
That is not a personal statement Mrs Breyer and I must therefore cut you off
Mr President this is not the first time I have had the opportunity to discuss the issue of GMOs with Parliament
We have done so several times and each time we have created more clarity in the area and now we have come to the legislation
I would like to thank the rapporteurs of the committees which have been working on the subject including Mr Bowe of the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Consumer Protection
As has been pointed out during the debate this evening the directive currently before us seeks to make the decision-making process more efficient and more transparent while at the same time ensuring a high level of protection for health and the environment
In the long term the directive will thus hopefully increase public confidence in the legislation in this area
I believe that is a crucial point
In line with the precautionary principle in the field of health and the environment the Commission proposal aims firstly to toughen up the risk assessment to be carried out before authorisation for the release of GMOs is given and secondly to improve the chances of identifying and monitoring GMOs so that the competent authorities can react immediately and appropriately in the event of acute risk
Against this background I am glad to note that many of the proposed amendments improve on or clarify the Commission proposal
In many cases we shall be able to use the ideas behind Parliament amendments
We can accept of the amendments in full in part or in principle
Amongst others the amendments aimed at introducing a means of identifying genetically modified organisms will simplify though not reduce the monitoring and inspection measures
However the Commission will word these amendments a little differently and we would also like to position them slightly differently so that they fit in better with the rest of the text
The proposal seeks to meet the growing scepticism of the public towards biotechnology which is something all of the speakers have probably touched on
The Commission therefore cannot accept those amendments which change the balance and weaken the safety net which is built into the proposal including the principle that authorisation is to be for a limited period
On the strength of this principle all new information will be taken into account and it will be possible to amend the requirements in accordance with the latest knowledge
We have proposed a seven-year period
Mr Bowe said this must be my favourite number and others also asked why it should be seven years
Obviously there are several options which people could argue for
We saw it as a balance between the normal lifetime of a genetically modified product the monitoring system we have proposed and the need for the administrative procedures for this directive to be clear practical and founded on science in accordance with the precautionary principle
I would also like to add that I personally at any rate do not think that the seven-year period should be extended which means that I reject a number of the amendments
This applies to Amendments Nos and 
In the light of the debate which has taken place in the various Community institutions however the Commission can go along with an optional time-limit for the renewal of authorisations
In line with this the Commission is unable to accept Amendment No which is aimed at introducing tacit approval for trial releases in Category I In the Commission view the precautionary principle means that express written authorisation is required in all cases of release into the environment
Labelling is one of the means which creates openness and reduces public misgivings
The proposal therefore requires clear labelling of all genetically modified organisms which are placed on the market
If there are any doubts the labelling must state that the product may contain genetically modified organisms
If we introduce a system which does not require labelling below a given threshold companies which process genetically modified organisms will not receive the information they need in order to be able to fulfil the strict labelling requirements imposed by the product legislation
Therefore the Commission is unable to accept Amendments Nos and 
Another important question is the liability of the Member States in connection with decisions on product approval
Here the Commission has proposed to change the committee procedure to give more influence to the Council
The participation of the European Parliament in the committee procedure will now take place in accordance with the modus vivendi agreement and will I believe be formalised in a decision on the new committee procedure
The Commission therefore cannot accept at this stage Amendment No which is aimed at making alterations to committee procedure b
Amendments Nos and strengthen the connection between this directive and product legislation and so ensure that the whole framework legislation on biotechnology involves an extensive environmental risk assessment
These amendments can therefore be accepted in principle after some rewording
However the Commission cannot accept the removal or any alteration of Article as proposed in Amendments Nos and 
The question of liability in Amendments Nos and is currently being considered in the Commission which intends to publish a white paper on liability
A good deal of progress has been made in this area and the Commission will of course present its white paper as soon as possible
We cannot accept Amendments Nos and which are aimed at regulating the import and export of genetically modified organisms
These amendments would pre-empt the final wording of the Protocol on Biosafety which is currently under discussion
I would also like to draw attention to Amendments Nos and on public inquiries or consultation in connection with trial releases
The Commission is able to accept these amendments in principle but we would like to see them reworded so that they ensure agreement with the Århus Convention on public participation in the decision-making process
Amendment Nos and are acceptable in principle because they confirm that the Council and the European Parliament can request the Commission to consult with the Ethics Committee on general ethical problems in connection with the release of genetically modified organisms
Finally I would like to emphasise that apart from the question of the fixed-period authorisation the amendments which the Commission has accepted in full in part or in principle have resulted in a clear improvement of the quality of the proposal
An example of this is Amendment No which will simplify the monitoring and detection of GMOs
In my view the amendments make the Commission text clearer and sharper and will therefore create a sensible and feasible framework for achieving the high level of safety we all wish to see for the release of GMOs into the environment
Mr President I find it unacceptable that the Commissioner has been coming here for the past six years and announcing that a White Paper on liability is imminent
We debated Directive No exactly a year ago
There too we called for the introduction of liability
The Commissioner said there would be a White Paper in a few weeks time
But a White Paper is not a directive
Six years have passed since the Green Paper
Commissioner I think what you are doing here is gradually becoming an insult to our intelligence
You refuse liability by stalling us for six years with a horizontal directive
I would now like you to tell us exactly why you keep lying to us and in particular why you said there would be a White Paper in a few weeks time and why you are stalling us again now
Even then we would still be far from having a directive
That means it would still take years
Where I ask myself is the own responsibility of industry and science
I find it totally irresponsible and no longer acceptable for you to stall us like this
Mr President we are moving quite a long way away from the actual proposal but I would like to emphasise that I have definitely not promised Mrs Breyer in the past that there would be a proposal for a directive on liability
We have previously discussed the question and we have worked on a green paper
It is an extremely complicated issue which produces a great many reactions and of course it takes time to get such a proposal through
That is why I have emphasised this evening that we will make an effort to have it ready as quickly as possible but the Commission has not yet finished its work on the proposal
Mrs Breyer also knows very well that these are the conditions for presenting a proposal in Parliament
Mr President I am asking for the floor because I was personally addressed and attacked in the last but one statement by Mrs Breyer and if she is given the floor again this must be clarified
She said that because we are in favour of an optional time-limit that means we regard people as guinea-pigs
That really is absurd
The fact is that the Commission evidently sees a need for introducing a time-limit
We say there need to be scientific grounds for doing so
If there are scientific grounds then it should be done so it has nothing to do with guinea-pigs
For there are some areas where no such grounds exists where no scientific reasons can be found for setting a time-limit and that is the issue
The issue has nothing at all to do with guinea-pigs or whatever but concerns a procedure that is commensurate with the risk
Thank you
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at am
I shall now suspend the sitting for a few minutes
The sitting was suspended at pm and resumed at pm
End-of-life vehicles
The next item is the report A by Mr Florenz on behalf of the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Consumer Protection on the proposal for a Council Directive on end-of-life vehicles CSYN
Mr President ladies and gentlemen eight or nine million or cars a year are discarded in the European Community
That calls for rules and I think it was high time the European Commission addressed this issue
I was a little annoyed to find that in this very important area which is important not just to environment policy but also to economic policy we received a proposal from the Commission that contained no annexes or rather annexes that were empty
For we know that the annexes are the crux of the matter
Normally we have tended to send this kind of proposal back
But since we have started we may as well try to go on with our endeavour
I believe this directive has set a good course
There are some areas where it needs tightening up a bit
And in some areas it is very strict
In committee we decided by a fairly substantial majority to concentrate only on twoand three-wheeled vehicles unlike the Commission which wants to set out broader rules
The object of this directive is to ensure that in future vehicles that have reached the end of their life can only be deregistered on production of a certificate of destruction which may sound very good at first but which is in my view rather difficult to achieve in some Member States at least
A little more work needs be done here and we have made a few proposals to that end
Article concerns the treatment of end-of-life vehicles
I believe here too a few nuances are needed but basically we will follow the Commission line
Another point I do not entirely understand is how the costs will be distributed in future in Europe
The Commissioner reverted to a rather fuddy-duddy approach and opted for no costs for the last owner user
No doubt that sounds quite interesting to a politician especially when elections are on the horizon
But no costs for the last user either that can never be
That is a fallacy
I think we have overlooked the fact that no costs will automatically lead to a monopoly and as we all know all too well monopolies always lead to concentration processes which are always a bad thing
That really will drive the small and medium-sized enterprises that we keep supporting and praising in our electioneering speeches out of the market
Jobs will be lost
It will cut the regional incomes of our petrol stations of our garages
After all I would not drive to some posh body repair shop to have my car deregistered I would go to my local dealer who lives in my village and has been looking after my car for years
I believe that is the wrong approach
My proposal is that the Member States should be responsible together with the economic operators involved ie the manufacturer recoverer shredder last owner etc for developing a system at their own cost that will where possible involve no cost for the last owner but not par ordre de moufti 
I think an insurance system like the one for motor vehicles where everyone pays in one euro a month would be quite a good solution
That would certainly have been in my amendment
There is a second point and here for once I agree with the Commissioner in fact I am quite enthusiastic and that is the very exacting recovery targets
These very exacting recovery targets will without doubt require the industry to make quite an effort
And that is a good thing for we have a great number hundreds of thousands millions of cars in Europe and obviously we want to go on having them
But precisely because we want to have them we also need sensible recovery quotas
I believe the committee has moved in the wrong direction here because it has accepted an amendment by a colleague of mine whom I normally hold in very high regard that prescribes that nothing more will be done until the year 
If I am interpreting that amendment correctly then in future the motor industry will only have to ensure that there are no passengers in the car apart from that it can send the car to the shredder and do whatever it wants
That is not environmentally friendly and you know that this is something I keep a very close eye on
I believe the Commission approach is a little too harsh but if it could be toned down a little the basic principle would be right
It is precisely because we have nine million tonnes of scrap cars that we need recycling rules
We turned the whole of Europe upside down for one ridiculous little package and introduced packaging regulations for it
We are now deciding on the labelling to go with this packaging regulation the rapporteur is sitting behind me
So if we fix a recycling quota for such a small matter then we surely also need to have recycling quotas for nine million tonnes of scrap cars and certainly before the year 
I do not think this is acceptable
A lot of lobbying is going on here but we will put a stop to it
We may quarrel about the ban on hazardous substances
The Commission has proposed values and parameters which in my view are very tough
In this field too we are now seeing an enormous expansion
I would stick to the Commission principle and propose a combined committee made up of Directorates-General III and XII which would make a critical scientifically sound proposal after three years on whether these tough rules need to be maintained and implemented
I know it is sacrilege to invite DG III and DG XII to the same table but I do not think it is such a bad idea
Some people want to ban PVC
I cannot judge the merits of that
I am not an expert in chemistry
But if PVC is dangerous then all this junk should be banned in a horizontal directive and not stigmatised in an individual secondary directive
The Commission needs to hurry up here and that is where you Mrs Bjerregaard come in
I know you have some very important colleagues who are slowing this whole business down
It is up to you to see to this horizontal directive
This kind of thing cannot be regulated in the directive we have here
That is stigmatisation and I do not think it is right
I am a passionate supporter of voluntary agreements
If there are Member States which dispose of their old cars in line with the objectives of the European directives then for God sake provided they can be monitored we should also allow them to retain their voluntary agreements
Instructions from above are always a second best
Mr President in this debate it falls to me to represent the views of the committee which has offered an opinion to the Environment Committee which I have to say was very favourably received and I thank the rapporteur and the members of the committee for accepting many of our amendments
I can therefore commend the report itself to the House on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee
In relation to that report we do not just have to take on board the importance of the ideas expressed by Mr Florenz about recycling endorse them though I do
He is absolutely correct there are large tonnages of waste coming from cars every year
Much of it is not metal and much of it has to be dealt with under very difficult circumstances We need a serious and proper approach to it
Certainly one of the outcomes of this would be a more orderly market-place one in which recycling takes place not in the traditional scrapyard which we are all familiar with but in a proper recycling facility which will create employment opportunities and the kind of jobs which are so sorely lacking in many parts of the Union and which will isolate the metals and other substances from cars and put them to good economic use
There are two issues we cannot ignore and I would press on the House
The first is the issue of leaded steel
We have some amendments before us tonight which recognise the difficulties involved in removing certain metals from cars completely
I hope we will endorse those amendments tonight to ensure that the recycling of cars is done in an environmentally friendly way that does not require additional expenditure of energy which if we took out all the metals referred to by the Commission would be needed
In addition I should like to point out that it is very important from the point of view of the final consumer that take-back is free of charge perhaps the consumer could even receive the deposit back but take-back must be free of charge
That is very important if we are to ensure that the system functions effectively
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I believe we are aiming at two major objectives with this directive
First we want to dispose of these eight million vehicles properly and secondly we want to dump as few as possible as landfill
The question is how do we achieve that
I believe that first we must guarantee take-back free of charge to the last owner and for several reasons one of which is of course social
For it is surely not acceptable to penalise the last owner in this way
Many others have had the benefit of this car many others have driven it
The manufacturers sold it of course so they also benefited from it
So if we take this approach we must distribute the cost fairly among everyone and not just foist it on the last owner
That is why I say no charge for the last owner
How the Member States apply that is of course their business
There is the Dutch system there is the German system the French system I do not want to lay down any rules
It is the principle that concerns me
And there is a second reason
What I ask you is happening today in countries where disposal is either self-financing or is cost free
In those countries used cars are stored illegally or exported to the east
Surely that cannot be our waste-disposal policy
In Germany some % of used cars are transported in an exodus to the east
So it is quite clear to me that we must insist on freedom of charge
Nor will that spell the death of small and medium-sized enterprises
After all what does the motor industry do in the case of services of supply contracts
It invites tenders and there is competition The same will apply to the recovery of old cars
However and this is my second point I believe we must draw a distinction between old and new cars
After all we cannot expect a car that was built years ago to satisfy today requirements
That would be like saying that ayear-old car had to meet the Euro standard for under the current legislation on exhaust gas
So we must ensure that as few old cars as possible are dumped but we certainly cannot lay down what quota is to be recovered in what way
Just imagine in real life an old car is taken to the shredder goes through the shredder at most you can determine the weight before and after but not how the individual materials are used that is quite absurd
It would mean that the very people who keep fighting bureaucracy would have to set up an enormous monitoring system for old cars which would be impossible to verify
I think we should only decide on matters that we can also guarantee and verify
So for old cars we can restrict the materials that may be dumped but not set a sub-quota on how they may be used
For new cars however which are being manufactured now we need an ambitious system to ensure that they are as recycling-friendly as possible
So in that case I am in favour of a type approval that lays down such quotas
There we can carry out checks as we do with the crash test as we do for exhaust gas emissions
For new cars we must apply stringent reuse and recycling requirements
After all the question of application is the key question
Mr Florenz said in his nice way that we would be taking a softer line and the directive would only apply from the year 
Let me tell him that is total rubbish
We say the directive should apply immediately and to all cars
Regardless of how they are serviced regardless of any spare parts they contain all cars must be taken back and recovered free of cost at once not just in as the Commissioner proposes
So we are taking a more stringent line
Secondly we say that the type approval rules as from must provide in precise terms that new cars must be recycling-friendly
That too makes this legislation more stringent
That means to put it mildly that it is not right of Mr Florenz to say that we would be watering down these Commission proposals in any respect at all
On the contrary we are following a different system But I am firmly convinced that we are tightening up the Commission proposal for the sake of environmental protection and consumer protection and moving it in the right direction
It is quite obvious to me that we need clarification on the question of heavy metals which is why we must now make it clear once and for all in what areas we want or do not want heavy metals
Mr President the proposed directive under discussion is particularly important and concerns all of us as users of motor vehicles
I am not going to go over the ground covered by my colleagues Mr Florenz and Mr Lange but will instead mention a few points which I feel are essential
Firstly some people are calling for a ban on PVC but we must be consistent
Calling for a ban on PVC is in complete contradiction with our recent call to vehicle manufacturers to build vehicles that consume less and therefore have lower levels of emissions
It is common knowledge that if vehicles cannot use PVC they will be heavier and will therefore consume more
So we must be consistent
On the other hand I totally agree with Amendment No tabled by Mr Lange In my opinion it is essential to make a clear distinction between old and new vehicles that will receive type approval before and after respectively
At least this gives vehicle manufacturers an idea of the constraints to be imposed on them after 
Finally it is essential to carry out a risk assessment of the materials and substances included in Annex II
In my opinion it would be better to assess these risks and if a risks exists to then look at the exemptions that could be granted
That would allow us in this case to achieve an appropriate balance between the environment and the motor industry
These are the points which I feel are particularly important if we are to find a solution to a problem that is sweeping through our entire industrial society
I sincerely hope that appropriate solutions can be found to solve this problem of end-of-life vehicles particularly since we are now all aware of it
Mr President Commissioner I should like to say that I was impressed by this proposal for a directive
Mr Florenz has also done his work well although I would actually rate his work in other areas more highly than in this one
He has not been quite as tough as he has tended to be in other circumstances
The Committee on the Environment Public Health and Consumer Protection has however sharpened up the directive and I sincerely hope that the Commission will now approve it
I should like to mention one or two points
It is abundantly clear that there should be some form of manufacturer responsibility for cars as well
It would therefore be reasonable for manufacturers to bear the major share of the responsibility but in point of fact the consumer alone foots the bill it is always the consumer who has to pay
However the final consumer should be able to get rid of his or her car free of charge
I believe that this is necessary if the scheme is to work
There should also be quotas and rules regarding the quantities to be recycled using different methods
As regards new cars far more stringent criteria need to be introduced as quickly as possible
We know the industry often claims that to do so would be impossibly difficult or expensive but it then goes on to do just that
In a number of different areas the industry has shown that it is capable of making the necessary adaptations
Bearing in mind that cars eventually have to be scrapped environmentally unfriendly materials such as lead mercury chromium and cadmium should be eliminated that much is patently clear
My group and I also think that the same should apply to PVC since if we allow it in cars it is never going to be clear to people that we want to eliminate this material only we have to wait for a horizontal directive in order to do so
You cannot explain such things to ordinary people In all probability it is only our politicians who understand them
Consequently I think it should be included in this proposal
Mr President I have two initial remarks to make
The first concerns so-called historic vehicles
In a limited number of cases these vehicles are kept by their owners either for restoration or as a source of spares
They are part of our industrial heritage and their preservation must be encouraged
We therefore fully support Amendment No tabled by the rapporteur
My second remark concerns two-wheel vehicles which cannot be regarded as a threat to the environment for the simple reason that the concepts of end of life and discarding do not apply to them
Although a few may attain the hallowed status of historic vehicles the ruthless world of two wheels is typified by cannibalism as parts are easy to strip off and many owners carry out maintenance and minor repairs themselves
Two-wheel vehicles are therefore generally stripped and their components naturally reused
I must also highlight Amendment No which concerns the recycling or recovery percentages
It maintains our ambitious objectives but based on the experience of the packaging directive it pragmatically provides for the option to periodically review these objectives and alter them if necessary
We will also support Amendment No which rightly stipulates that the free recovery of vehicles will not be backdated
On the other hand we will vote against Amendment No which would ban the use of PVC for three reasons
Firstly the usefulness of this material is indisputable
Secondly it is an anticorrosive product which extends the life of vehicles reduces their weight and thereby has a positive impact on consumption and pollution as indicated by Mrs Grossetête
And thirdly the majority of PVC is reused or recycled and it would therefore be particularly illogical to move away from the Commission horizontal approach in this respect
Mr President this proposal for a directive is a stroke of luck for the environment since assigning responsibility to the manufacturer was long overdue and it was also high time waste prevention applied to the motor vehicle sector too
I am glad the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Consumer Protection also stood up for freedom of charge to the last user
I very much regret that Mr Florenz has expressed his personal view here rather than that of the Environment Committee
I hope that tomorrow Members will also stand by their amendment on banning PVC from the year 
I find it shocking to hear that there are obviously plans to bow to the PVC industry here tomorrow
And let me tell Mrs Grossetête and others that we are not talking about banning plastic
We are talking about banning PVC about products involving chlorine
There is actually a bioplastic and other plastic materials
The argument she put forward was quite absurd and I must say that unfortunately that shows that she was not well-informed and that obviously this is merely a question of arguments 
The President cut the speaker off
Mr President problems with end-of-life vehicles which are to be scrapped are largely due to the way they are produced
That is why we should both ensure that vehicle parts are reused and that specially harmful substances are not used in the new generation of vehicles
That brings us to PVC
Like other Members I wonder what the Commission intends to do about this
As we know PVC is not the solution of the future even though in the material it sends us the PVC industry tries to distort the Swedish PVC action plan for example so as to persuade us that the Swedes think PVC is a health product which everyone should have more of
In fact they do not think that at all
PVC has a wide range of applications but its disposal creates environmental problems
PVC produces even more waste after incineration than the amount that was sent to the incineration plant
Incinerated PVC produces dioxins which are among the most dangerous toxins that exist
In addition the plasticisers used in PVC the so-called phthalates are suspected of being hormone interferers and in legislation which is geared to the future we must observe the precautionary principle
Every time that PVC is involved in a proposal for a directive we are told that this problem in particular cannot be looked at on its own or vertically but that we should look at it globally and horizontally and that the Commission will do the thinking for us
As far as I am aware it has been meaning to do so since the s
Today the Commission must tell us when it will take an initiative in the area of PVC because that will have a bearing on the way we vote tomorrow
Mr President I want to congratulate Mr Florenz because reuse really should be given priority but I also want to say absolutely no to the PVC ban because we do not yet know of any viable alternatives
To include the collection of used parts from repaired cars would involve the entire garage waste disposal system and in the final analysis that has nothing to do with the directive
Take-back free of charge would also destroy market forces and above all would exclude existing firms from the recovery chain and produce expensive bureaucratic obstacles to trade
On Amendment No I would say it is a positive sign for environmental agreements because with many agreements on end-of-life vehicles in Europe compliance tends to be concentrated on just a few articles
On Amendment No in my view the technical annex is too detailed and also contains provisions that make no sense
Mr President I would like to begin by thanking Mr Florenz for the work which the Committee on the Environment has done on this important and complex proposal
The Committee on the Environment has proposed amendments and with a further there is a total of 
Some of the amendments clarify or improve the proposal and I can already say that the Commission is able to accept of them in full or in part
There are also some amendments which dilute the Commission proposal and reduce the level of environmental protection
Here I am thinking in particular of topics such as producer responsibility recovery targets and the scope and implementation of the proposal
These elements are central to the Commission proposal and we cannot accept any watering-down of them
I would like to comment on the many amendments in groups
Let me begin with the scope of the proposal
Here I shall comment on two aspects in particular
The first aspect which relates to Amendments Nos and the second part of concerns veteran vehicles
We do not think that veteran vehicles which are in museums or owned by private individuals constitute waste They are therefore not covered by the proposal but we can of course make that clearer in the proposal itself
Then there is the proposal concerning the extent to which this should apply to two and three-wheeled vehicles
We have also considered this and we think that these vehicles should only be exempt from Articles and of the proposal
Amendment No means that two and three-wheeled vehicles would be exempt from all the articles apart from Article of the proposal and we cannot agree to that
Then there are the heavy metals and PVC
In its proposal the Commission has chosen to require that some of the heavy metals should be removed from the vehicles before they are reused and I see that the Committee on the Environment is in favour of a clear phasing-out of such heavy metals and a list of derogations which can be amended through the committee procedure
Unfortunately I have reservations about this so at the moment I cannot support Amendments Nos and and Mrs Jensen was quite right that my answer concerning PVC would be that we are currently working on a horizontal initiative so I cannot accept Amendments Nos and 
Then there is the question of the collection and take-back of end-of-life vehicles Here the Commission accepts Amendments Nos and which clarify the text but we cannot accept Amendments Nos and 
Amendments Nos and require careful consideration so we are not accepting them today
I would like to emphasise that both free take-back and the principle of producer responsibility which have also featured strongly in the debate today are key elements in connection with making production and consumption more sustainable in the longer term
This is also the reason why we cannot accept Amendment No or Amendments Nos and but we can endorse Amendment No 
As far as recycling reuse and recovery of end-of-life vehicles is concerned the Commission cannot accept Amendment No because it would remove the short-term recovery target
Then there is Amendment No which makes the targets less clear and Amendment No which represents a serious obstacle to achieving the long-term targets and is also unacceptable
We cannot accept Amendments Nos and which would make it difficult to monitor whether the quantified targets have been reached but we can accept Amendments Nos and 
There are also the amendments relating to implementation and lastly there is the question of environmental agreements which we cannot accept at the present time
In this context I must point out in passing that this concerned an entirely different debate when we were discussing a different proposal from the Committee on the Environment regarding voluntary agreements
I hope it will be possible to find a compromise in the course of further negotiations which strikes a balance between considerations relating to the environment consumers and industry
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at am
Unilateral US measures against banana regime
The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions
B by Mr Querbes and others on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left Nordic Green Left to the Commission on unilateral retaliatory measures taken by the United States against Community exports in the wake of the bananas disputeB by Mr Aldo and others on behalf of the Union for Europe Group to the Commission on unilateral US retaliatory measures in the dispute over the European banana import regimeB by Mr Castagnède and Mr Hory on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance to the Commission on the new WTO panel on bananas and unilateral US threats of retaliatory customs actionB by Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel and Mr Moorhouse on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party to the Commission on the functioning of the WTO Dispute-Settlement Procedures and the USEU banana disputeB by Mrs Mann on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists to the Commission on unilateral measures taken by the United States against the import of EU goodsB by Mr Souchet on behalf of the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations to the Commission on unilateral retaliatory measures which the United States of America is threatening to take in the dispute over the European banana import regimeB by Mr Kreissl-Dörfler and others on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament to the Commission on the WTO and the trade dispute between the EU and the USA concerning the common organisation of the market in bananasB by Mr Kittelmann and others on behalf of the Group of the European People Party to the Commission on unilateral trade measures taken by the United States of America against selected European products and the WTO Dispute Settlement Procedure
Mr President I would like to point out that the measures agreed on by the United States the problems involved in applying the regulation on the COM for bananas and the conflicts that have arisen in this area mean that we must consider two basic issues
The first is that the Union must defend its internal law which is an expression of its autonomy It is being attacked by rules such as Section that are applied with extraterritorial effect and that are used to defend interests rather than rights
The second is the need to guarantee that the arbitration procedures are effective These have been used against the Union in the past and now due to circumstances they are being called into question because of the unilateral protectionist measures that have been taken
Both questions lead us to the conclusion that we are pursuing an open market policy that is not reciprocated and that benefits the United States
The US not only wants European markets to be open to products from the United States they must also be open in the way that the United States dictates
We must ensure that we maintain the Union legislative autonomy in this case the COM for bananas is symbolic
What we are trying to do is to assert the Union autonomy
Thank you Mrs Sierra González and thank you for keeping to your speaking time
I would remind the House that I have to be extremely strict this evening in order for us to stay on schedule
Mr President since my election to this House I have repeatedly denounced the constant attacks by the United States against the COM for bananas
Despite the far-reaching concessions granted by the European Union during the reform of the COM this new regime continues to be attacked by the United States which basically wants it to be dismantled
I must point out that at the time we fought against those concessions as they undermine the basic principle of Community preference
The threats now being made by the United States in total defiance of the rules governing the multilateral trading system are coming directly after the establishment of the transatlantic partnership
The UPE Group is therefore calling for an appropriate response from the European Union
In essence the European Union can under no circumstances be subject to United States sanctions if no decision has been made by the relevant bodies of the WTO in accordance with the applicable procedures guaranteeing the observance of due process
If the Americans were to go down the road of unilateral action they should realise that they would bear a heavy responsibility for weakening the international trading system
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I do not want to go into detail today
Some Members have already addressed certain questions and I assume that others here present will be referring to many of the details
If the consequences of these fresh disputes with the United States were not so serious this quarrel might seem amusing
But the consequences are very serious and I hope that we will reach a satisfactory solution in the very near future otherwise we would seriously jeopardise transatlantic relations
Let me remind you the European Union and the United States did most to initiate the dispute-settlement procedure within the WTO
This procedure may not be perfect in every way and may need to be developed further but it is the only international instrument we have to resolve trade disputes
The United States doubts whether the new banana market organisation is WTO compatible
That is indeed its right
But it does not have the right to take unilateral measures against its trade partners and to issue sanctions such as in this case the absurd % duties on products from EU Member States
It does not have the right to take it upon itself to deliver a verdict
The conduct of the United States does considerable damage to the WTO dispute settlement procedure
It makes the preliminary negotiations for the new WTO round considerably more difficult and it damages confidence in the process of transatlantic partnership
It gives the impression that the American margin for play in trade policy is increasingly determined by a purely national political agenda which causes justified fears that it is trying to impose a particular American trade philosophy worldwide
That is playing with fire and puts the WTO itself in the firing line
Protectionism must not always be seen as the solution to national problems
In the scheme of things we are all dependent on one another and the WTO is an instrument for harmonising egoistic national approaches It is not beloved of everyone it is not perfect but it is extremely necessary
To approach national issues such as bananas hormones and many others I could mention in emotional political terms takes the reason out of politics as a whole and sets in motion a trend that may not be stoppable
My group fully supports the Commission position
You have before you an appropriate joint resolution from the Committee on External Economic Relations that strongly rejects the unilateral measures taken by the United States fully supports the Commission and moreover in my view can form a good basis for further European policy measures
With regard to the banana dispute the crisis affecting the relations between the European Union its Member States its ACP partners and the United States illustrates the ambiguities of the EU trade policy
Faced with the determined stance of the Americans who are skilfully playing a double game with their European partners by seeking both partnership and sanctions the European institutions appear divided powerless paralysed and reluctant to truly defend European interests
There are several reasons for this
Firstly the American desire for domination is not perceived as such by many Member States
Secondly the Member States increasingly appear to have divergent interests
And thirdly the absence of democracy within the European institutions is ensuring that any complicity is obscured
The fact remains that we are faced with a situation in which the United States has unilaterally decided to publish a list of European products which it intends to sanction by raising customs duties to % if the EU does not amend its new banana import regime
In addition they have taken this decision even before the WTO has decided whether or not this regime is compatible with its rules
Mr President as US Ambassador Vernon Weaver recently made quite plain in the Committee on External Economic Relations the current banana war is a test case
The real test will come when the EU bans meat containing hormones in a few weeks time
Next on the cards and here too Mr Weaver did not mince his words will come genetic manipulation
Under the pretext of offering the consumer a wider choice US firms are to be allowed to put genetically modified tomatoes and laboratory-made soya on our supermarket shelves And if possible they will not label it as such since the poor consumer might find it too hard to take in so much information
The issue goes far beyond bananas That is precisely why we cannot give way to the unjustified US demand even though and in fact just because they are threatening lunatic sanctions
After one WTO panel we revised the organisation of the banana market
Whether that revised regime is compatible with the rules is something that same panel will decide again
Any form of US sanction against European firms prior to the panel findings would deprive the WTO of all meaning
If any penalty duty is imposed before the panel findings we might as well shut down the WTO
Unfortunately the Commission has to take some of the blame for this situation
The founders of the WTO manoeuvred themselves into this position because world trade is not being regulated according to the principle of sustainable development consumer protection and social protection
Instead the ruling principles are economic growth and profit seeking
With a view to the forthcoming millennium round it is high time to formulate concrete reform proposals
Precautionary measures the environment and local development must become the guiding principles of economic action
At the high-level WTO meetings in March the Commission ought to begin by submitting the appropriate documents if it really wants as promised to make transparency the primary obligation of EU officials
Today protests in front of Parliament by the French farmers have given some idea of what they think of the adjustment to the world market and the mania for liberalisation and deregulation as also what they will be capable of once they really get going
Mr President the Group of the European People Party supports the joint resolution
We consider it most important for the WTO rules to be observed
It is absolutely unacceptable for the USA to threaten unilateral measures again European firms that really have nothing at all to do with the banana market organisation with the dispute about it
It is also entirely unacceptable for US policy to give in to the pressure from Chiquita and others
We must support the Commission in its demand for respect for the WTO rules
But the EU must also respect the WTO rules which means that if we lose again at the next panel we will have to revise the market organisation again
I would ask the Commission to consider how we will react if that happens
For myself I would say that I do not regard this as a good organisation of the market
It discriminates against producers in Latin America and it does not protect small producers against the multinationals as is said so often for there are small independent producers in Latin America too
In Ecuador % of producers have fewer than hectares and they are owned nationally not owned Chiquita
In Costa Rica there are fair-trade bananas and the organisation of the market discriminates against all of them
For Commissioner Pinheiro actually to say two weeks ago in regard to my report on bananas that the Commission should give the multinationals in the ACP states money to build up banana plantations is pure hypocrisy if at the same time we say we want to defend the small producers against the big shots
Perhaps quite different issues are at stake here
But that should not prevent us from insisting again and again that the WTO rules must be respected and that we cannot accept the US attacks
Nor can we accept the US views on hormone-containing meat and on the question of genetically modified organisms
Here we must stand up for our legislation But should we find that our legislation is not compatible with the WTO rules then indeed we have to revise it
I would also draw Sir Leon Brittan attention to the debate we have just held on the Bowe report
There the committee proposed an amendment to the effect that we should take account of socio-economic criteria when authorising genetically modified organisms
I believe that if that amendment is adopted and has an influence on the legislation it will be a through ball for the Americans
We have to prove on the basis of scientific evidence that our policy is the right one and this applies both to the hormone issue and to GMOs
We regard the precautionary principle as the foundation of our policy not some arbitrary socio-economic criteria
Here too we must take care we do not come up against new problems in the autumn
Mr President I wish to begin by welcoming the support that Parliament has given generally to the Commission on this issue and also thanking it for the resolution that has been drafted which we find very supportive
The questions raised two key issues what is the Commission doing to avoid the threatened US sanctions and if sanctions are nevertheless applied what does it intend to do then
All our actions both present and future are and will be taken in full compliance with WTO rules Two wrongs do not make a right
That does not however mean that we are powerless
American sanctions are illegal because they are based on a unilateral determination that the European Community has failed to bring the banana regime into compliance with WTO rules
We have therefore sought to persuade the Americans to submit the question of the conformity of the new banana regime to a WTO panel procedure in accordance with Article 
In fact WTO procedures make this an obligatory step before any sanctions can be authorised
As early as last September and in the weeks and months following we offered to reduce the WTO procedure to an absolute minimum of time
We even initiated the procedure ourselves inviting the United States to participate
But the fundamental problem is that at the end of the Uruguay Round the US Administration promised Congress that it would take sanctions immediately at the end of the period for implementation of the WTO panel ruling in application of the domestic Section procedure
The Administration now has to prove that it can deliver
That is the simple American political background
The United States has therefore ignored the fact that where there is disagreement between the parties the conformity of implementing measures must first be tested through the obligatory WTO procedures
In the bananas case the American Administration promised Congress to implement sanctions at the latest by March whatever happens in the WTO
That is what ties the hands of the US Administration
That is why the United States has refused to participate in any WTO procedure on the conformity of the new EC banana regime simply because that would have taken the Americans beyond their self-imposed internal deadline which does not comply with WTO rules
By initiating the Article procedure ourselves we succeeded in bringing Ecuador to launch its own procedure to challenge the conformity of our regime
This procedure is now under way and panel reports are due by April
After this the normal procedures provide that the other side has the right to appeal
Meanwhile the US has continued to press for authorisation to take retaliatory measures by March
There has been a major debate on this in which almost all the WTO members who spoke supported our position that there cannot be authorisation of retaliation in the absence of a WTO ruling on the conformity of the regime
We will now continue to argue before the arbitrator that he can only determine the level of any retaliatory action if and when the non-conformity of the new banana regime has been determined
Otherwise the arbitrator would be sentencing the European Community while its guilt has not been proven
We have also asked the WTO General Council to give an authoritative interpretation on this question
Finally we are challenging the conformity of the American Section legislation
We have requested a panel which will in due course be set up
The US from its side has requested consultations with us and we will enter those consultations in good faith
This brings me to the second question what would we do if the Americans go ahead with sanctions on March
Firstly we would challenge the legality of those sanctions through the WTO dispute settlement procedures
Finally as long as those sanctions lasted we would have the option of retaliating quite legally by withdrawing concessions or imposing measures in areas not covered by WTO disciplines
There are such measures that could be imposed and we would be entitled and would give the most serious consideration to applying them in the face of such flagrant breach of the law
Mr President we support the Commission view that the unilateral action by the United States is illegal as it is outrageous and totally irresponsible
Its very threat is already causing severe damage to cashmere garment producers who are wholly innocent parties in this dispute and who stand to lose around GPB million of export orders and possibly jobs
By these vindictive actions the United States has prejudiced not only their own reputation but also the future of the transatlantic partnership
Precisely what the USA asked for an arbitration panel under Article I believe in the letter to Sir Leon of July is now under way
We must condemn the crude attempt at intimidation by the United States singling out for exemption from sanctions products from Denmark and the Netherlands because these countries voted against the banana regime in Council
On this point I wish to ask the Commission what mechanism is at the disposal of the US authorities that would allow them to distinguish between products originating in say Denmark or Holland as opposed to those from France or the United Kingdom
The points we make in the resolution of the Committee on External Economic Relations are very clear
We demand that the European Union fulfill its obligations to our ACP trade partners and we expect the Commission to achieve that objective within the WTO framework
Finally we cannot and will not tolerate further damage to our industries by a regime whose ambition is matched only by its arrogance
Mr President perhaps we have not done very well with the banana regime we have adopted in Europe
But to react to that by immediately declaring war by imposing a % duty on candles weapons pullovers and suchlike is not in my view the right answer
It is the old method of trying to get your way by might and main that was used in the wars of the past
The winner is the one who can shoot most people dead
We have learned a lot more since then in Europe
Basically it is a question of finding a better solution
That means if we have two different points of view we should acknowledge that both sides could be right
Then we should try to meet each other halfway and say let us not just accept solution or let us also try solution or and go on until we find a solution that everyone can accept and these solutions must be worked out at a high official level
Mr President because two or three major American companies control the banana production of the Latin American countries the United States which does not itself produce any bananas at all is relentlessly maintaining its offensive against the Community import regime
Although the European Union has taken account of the WTO verdict by amending its regulations the United States is again threatening trade sanctions against imported European products
The United States also wants the EU to lift its embargo on imports of hormonised meat and is preparing an offensive against genetically modified organisms
On January the US ambassador to the European Union stressed that the banana dispute was a minor issue compared to the potential scope of the hormonised meat and GMO issues
This reaffirmation of the commercial and political domination of the United States and the latter desire to start the next round of negotiations from a position of strength are basically calling into question the WTO mechanisms
The motion for a resolution tabled jointly by my group and the Green Group condemns the threats of American sanctions
It urges the Commission to stand firm in the face of this new offensive so that we can continue to protect the interests of Community and ACP producers
While awaiting the next arbitration proceedings of the WTO panel an interim agreement has been obtained However the United States has not abandoned its threats
If the sanctions announced are applied unilaterally is the Commission ready to reply by applying equivalent retaliatory measures if necessary
Mr President I would like to thank Commissioner Brittan for being here at such a late stage in the evening as it shows his interest in this issue
Tonight we are showing our support for the Commission as the Commissioner himself pointed out There is therefore no point in repeating arguments that have already been put forward
I should like to make a few comments although I do not know if I shall receive any response to them
Firstly I would like to look at the problems that this crisis entails
The initial problem is that although during the final round in Marrakesh on the World Trade Organisation constitution we insisted that the dispute settlement procedure be included what we wanted was to combat American unilateralism
Now however Section of US external trade law is coming back to haunt us
Secondly it seems as though the Americans may be exempt from the dispute settlement procedure as it has not been possible to contest either the Helms-Burton Act or the DAmato Act effectively within the World Trade Organisation
Thirdly what we are concerned about particularly the members of Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs is whether or not the Commission really has sufficient resources to face up to the huge team of legal experts the United States has assembled in Geneva
It seems as though the United States is capable of winning almost all the cases we are bringing we have just mentioned the issue of hormones we have a possible appeal on genetically modified organisms and we also have the banana war
In other words if we do not soon reach an agreement on this issue and if the United States insists on multilateral measures the Community may have to reconsider to what extent it is prepared to submit to a multilateral mechanism which the United States itself does not seem to want to respect
Mr President during the last part-session in Brussels we discussed the banana issue with regard to the financial assistance to be granted to ACP countries suffering from reduced production
As we pointed out at the time the scale of the retaliatory measures announced seems to be disproportionate regardless of the rights and wrongs on each side
On our side this dispute threatens assistance for two peripheral regions Mr Mendonça will doubtless mention Madeira and for poor ACP countries which have no satisfactory alternative to banana production
As for the Americans this dispute does not threaten the interests of their own farmers just those of extremely powerful multinationals which operate in Latin American countries
While we obviously must be sensitive towards the populations of these countries it must be stressed that the market available both outside and within Europe is still very extensive regardless of the established quotas
We therefore support one of the oral questions put to the Commission about whether or not an understanding can be achieved within the WTO panel
As we inevitably have major reservations about the fairness of the American position we would also ask and this is also a policy suggestion whether the Commission is ready to rigorously and rapidly apply the trade policy instruments at its disposal
We must lend our full political support to the Commission continued firm position on this dispute as clearly indicated in Paragraph of the motion for a resolution which follows on from the oral questions tabled
By taking this step we are not simply trying to legitimately defend the interests of the people and areas affected which in this specific case are the banana-producing areas on one hand and the areas which would be hit by American retaliatory measures on the other
Much more importantly we are ultimately helping to ensure the multilateral resolution of disputes in accordance with WTO rules and consequently the rejection of unilateral retaliatory measures which use a political logic which we would rather not qualify
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen the United States of America is not satisfied that a WTO arbitration board convened on behalf of its interests and its multinationals in the dollar banana zone recently ordered the revision of the common organisation of the banana market
Instead the USA is continuing its offensive with the aim of destroying any Community banana support regime and wiping out the remaining production in less-developed and ultraperipheral regions as is happening in Madeira
However the most scandalous aspect of this offensive is its unilateral nature with total disregard for WTO structures
The USA is now threatening to impose new customs duties on European products exported to the United States In practice this would mean a ban on various products entering the American market including textile products
This offensive also includes new attacks to force the European Union to accept imports of American hormonised meat and genetically modified products with total disregard for the health of European consumers
Commissioner this offensive must be stopped in its tracks
If the USA carries out its threat it is essential that the EU should be able to retaliate immediately by clearly restricting the access of American products to the European market
It is also essential and fundamental that the Commission should use all available mechanisms under international trade law to reestablish the legality which the USA is trying to undermine
Mr President ladies and gentlemen as I come from an ultraperipheral banana-producing region of the European Union I wish to protest in the strongest terms and indicate my deep anger at the retaliatory stance taken by the United States of America in the latest dispute over the Community banana import regime
I must take this opportunity to point out that the European banana-producing regions include some of the ultraperipheral island regions which are still suffering from a lack of economic development In these regions banana production is the main and sometimes only source of income for thousands of families
We cannot begin to imagine the economic social and environmental damage which would have occurred in the autonomous region of Madeira if the European institutions had yielded to the pressures which American-controlled multinationals determined to defend their own interests are continuing to exert on the banana market
Under these circumstances it is clear that in order to protect itself the European Union must not submit in any way to the pressure exerted by the USA with regard to matters which may still be under discussion
The European institutions should within the various international bodies maintain their steadfast opposition to unilateral retaliatory trade measures
In this respect the sanctions announced by the USA are scandalous and are already starting to have negative effects on other sectors which have nothing to do with the infamous banana dispute
We totally support the Commission position as long as this remains resolutely in accordance with the spirit of the principles and rules of the World Trade Organisation However the Commission must be prepared as it seems to be to respond rigorously and rapidly if unilateral measures are applied by the United States
Mr President may I first of all say that those who have spoken in the latter part of the debate have pointed out that the action taken by the United States is not only action taken against parts of the Caribbean countries but also against parts of the European Union which are very dependent on bananas
In the case of some of the Caribbean countries if they gave up producing bananas they would be likely to be driven to being drug havens which would do more damage to the United States than it would do to the European Union
Mr Smith asked how can the United States discriminate against products completely unrelated to bananas such as cashmere and in the case of Italy pecorino and other products of other countries
Our view is that they have no right to do so whatsoever and that this is simply a bullying tactic designed to persuade the European Union to succumb to American threats
As to Article which was also a point that has been raised our view has always been that it is unlawful
Up to now we have been content to let it stay on the American statute book and only to take action if it is actually implemented
If it is implemented the action will certainly be taken
We were asked by Mr Medina Ortega whether we are able to face up to the American lawyers in these various threats
The answer is certainly Yes
We have done so as he has pointed out in the case of the Helms-Burton and DAmato Acts and we will do so in the face of all other legislation
What will we do if action is taken
First of all we will respond in the WTO by taking a case against the Americans as we have begun to do
Secondly if we win that case we will be entitled to retaliate lawfully against the United States but in addition to that we will have to give serious consideration to taking action which would be in accordance with the WTO but would involve the withdrawal of concessions which are not bound in the WTO and which the United States do not have as of right
I hope it does not come to that but the European Union is ready to defend its interests against anybody including the United States
Mr President perhaps I did not make myself clear to the Vice-President
The United States have exempted two European countries from sanctions
What mechanism do the United States authorities have at their disposal to distinguish between goods coming from these two countries as opposed to goods coming from any of the other 
I do not know how the United States proposes in practice to do that
It will be difficult for them
It is not a question for me because we think the action is unlawful in any event and we will take action against it
I agree with you that looked at from their own point of view they might well have some problems
I have received nine motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at am
The sitting was closed at pm
EC-Israel scientific and technical cooperation agreement
The next item is the report A by Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl on behalf of the Committee on Research Technological Development and Energy on the proposal for a Council Decision concluding the Agreement for scientific and technical cooperation between the European Community and the State of Israel CCNS
Mr President ladies and gentlemen back in Israel became the first non-European country to be fully involved in the framework programme for research and technological development and it remains the only non-European participant
The basis of this agreement is that research cooperation is fundamentally international in character and that it makes no sense to limit it to the territory of the EU if it would benefit both parties and if there are no other political objections
Israel pays and is treated like a Member State
The other states contributions are not reduced which means that the funding of the programme as a whole is topped up as a result of Israeli participation
Under the fourth framework programme which has been implemented since the number of calls for tenders for the various programmes was higher in and than at the end of the programme period
Although Israel anticipating the conclusion of the agreement began to contribute financially and submitted tenders subject to conclusion in the bulk of the funds for many programmes had already been allocated by that time
That is why Israel is very interested in full integration into the fifth framework programme from the outset
We all know that the start of a multiannual programme is an important phase and so for sheer reasons of time my first plea to the House is that we approve this agreement today
But it is of course essential to take account of the general political context too even in the case of a technical agreement
Let me say the following on that first of all there are many strong links between Israel and the European Union
The value of trade between us is twice as high as that of Israel trade with the United States
It is important that the Union relations with the Middle East and its influence in that region remain steady and strong
This agreement is one of many instruments that govern these relations and with which Parliament will deal in greater detail in March
I believe that EU-Israeli relations in general are so stable that they can withstand the difference important though it admittedly is in our respective assessments of the progress achieved in the peace process
And now my second point even during the fourth framework programme we were pressing for Palestinian research groups and companies to work with us and to be involved in projects
This agreement is therefore an indirect means of promoting mutual understanding
We shall insist that this cooperation be intensified and when we come to review the programme here in Parliament we shall check that this is actually happening
My third point is this if the agreement is implemented information networks will be set up under Article 
The Israeli side has expressed the wish to participate more fully in future evaluation measures
I would ask the European Parliament to support that wish
The fourth point I wish to make is that in order to reinforce this cooperation and to incorporate it into the same framework as the other agreements and cooperative projects we should ensure that regular contacts are established between the European Parliament and the Knesset so that the research cooperation can be monitored and promoted at parliamentary level
Some of the groups in this House believe that by approving the agreement and not suspending it we would be intervening in the internal political debate in Israel since as we all know a general election is about to be called there Let me say to you that our failure to approve the agreement today would constitute far more serious interference in Israel domestic politics and we have no right to exert heavy pressure on foreign governments to alter their domestic policies
Lastly as your rapporteur I should like to make the following comment relations between the Commission and Parliament are somewhat strained at the present time
For that reason it is my sincere wish Commissioner and not just a pious hope that in future negotiations the Commission will provide Parliament with comprehensive information from the very start and keep it abreast of the latest developments in the negotiating process
Applause
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen my group endorses the report and very largely agrees with what the rapporteur Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl has said
The Agreement on Scientific and Technical Cooperation between the European Community and the State of Israel allows us to build on past successes which began in at least as far as the present high level of cooperation is concerned
At that time Israel with the status of an associated state was allowed to take part in all non-nuclear programmes under the fourth framework programme for research and technological development
In a period of only three years joint projects costing a total of ECU million have been successfully implemented
However the added value deriving from cooperative arrangements is far greater than that
In fact some joint applications have been received
The continuation of this cooperation in the fifth framework programme is in the interests of both sides
Our own interest lies not only in the high quality of Israeli research but also the emerging adoption of European processes and standards and the future development of more marketing opportunities in the region
Israel for its part has an interest in being involved in the discussion on strategic developments in the research field which Israel alone cannot achieve
Moreover high-tech products are the only means whereby Israel balance of trade deficit like ours can be reduced
This cooperation in our mutual interest is therefore a long-term proposition
That is why it is natural that not only Israel but also our Committee on Research Technological Development and Energy and the great majority of my group favour the smoothest possible transition from the fourth to the fifth framework programme
Postponement of our decision for whatever reason would mean as has already been explained that the conference of foreign ministers on February could not ratify the agreement as a result of which Israel would be unable to take part in the first round of tendering which will take place in March and would be placed at a financial disadvantage as happened in the fourth framework R&D programme
In accordance with its gross domestic product Israel will contribute to the success of the fifth framework programme for research and technological development by making an annual commitment of around EUR million
Various members of our committee have had the opportunity to see at first hand the high quality of joint EU-Israeli research
At our insistence Palestinian companies and research establishments were also involved in joint projects
It is true that even greater efforts could be made in this direction as my honourable colleague said and indeed we are demanding progress here
In my own personal opinion further research cooperation can help in the long run to stabilise the peace process which it has to be said is seriously deadlocked
The aims of science are full understanding and effective communication
Its universal nature also offers a matrix for resolving conflicts that arise from sectional interests
Conversely however scientific cooperation can only flourish in the long term in a peaceful environment
Even if the procedure applied here is that of a simple hearing I would ask the House to approve the report
Mr President our group can also endorse the report and would like to see it implemented as soon as possible
We are delighted at Israel participation in the Community research programmes up to now and we look forward to the results of the cooperation between the European Union and the State of Israel in connection with the fifth framework programme
Israel was of course largely created by immigrants refugees and individuals with a very strong character who have been able to endure dictatorships and oppression and who in many cases have an extremely high standard of education to contribute
This has been reflected in the research programmes
What is being made available here for the cooperation between the European Union and the State of Israel is therefore a considerable mass of talent with high levels of education competence and diligence
We look forward to the cooperation and hope that the report can be implemented as soon as possible
Mr President our group is very pleased with this very reliable and broad-minded report by Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl
However we cannot approve it at this stage because we the European Union and the European Parliament would be being used by a head of state who has shown total disregard for the peace agreements and for the process of promoting peaceful coexistence in the region
As a result and for that reason alone we believe that it would be better to suspend the application of this agreement We must hope that after the elections we will see the arrival of a new government whose behaviour and positive attitude towards coexistence the United Nations resolutions the Oslo Agreements and the Wye Plantation Agreements show that guarantees do exist
We understand the situation in the region and believe that both parties should receive equal treatment In order to do so it would be more appropriate if instead of establishing cooperation between Palestinian firms and universities in Israel the European Parliament itself implemented an agreement with the Palestinian people its research organisations its university and its firms
This would be more fitting in that since the end of the Second World War when the UN was set up the question of consolidating the Palestinian state through a UN resolution has remained unresolved
By doing so the European Union would be giving equivalent equidistant and equal treatment to both parties involved in the conflict thereby showing that it does not allow itself to be swayed by either side
Therefore when it comes to the vote on this report our group will ask that it be referred back to committee so that it might indeed be approved under better circumstances
Mr President this report on the research agreement between the EU and Israel is no simple matter
I can go along with part of what Mr Marset Campos said here namely that this report which we had thought would support the peace process could just as easily be seen as a threat to that process if these issues are used to the wrong ends and in the political arena
As far as the content of this agreement is concerned those parts of the programme that relate to nuclear safety and fusion are of course excluded
These areas are not included in this research agreement a fact which I am pleased about
At the same time however I am concerned because we need to be aware of the fact that Israel has nuclear weapons even though the country denies this
I am a little anxious that in spite of everything funds will sneak in from other programmes precisely for use in research on nuclear fusion and nuclear activity
This is something that I simply cannot support
In this context mention also needs to be made of Mordechai Vanunu the Israeli researcher who disclosed details about nuclear weapons and nuclear energy research in Israel
It will soon be ten years since he was imprisoned
It would now be appropriate for Israel to release him as quickly as possible
There was an application for his release but that has now been rejected
I would like to ask Mrs Cresson what steps the Commission is taking to seek Mr Vanunu release
Openness is perhaps not Commissioner Cresson strong point but I would nevertheless like to appeal for efforts to be made to prevail on Israel to release Mr Vanunu
There are several other parts of this research project which I do not perhaps view as positively as the rapporteur does
One such area is space research We Greens do not think that the EU should take part in space research
We are therefore also against cooperation between the EU and Israel in this field
We are just as reluctant for such research to be conducted in the EU as we are for it to be conducted within the framework of agreements with other countries
Mr President the issue with which we are concerned today has an obvious political element
Renewing a link between Israel and the European Union in the middle of an electoral period could be looked on at least locally as support for the political powers
It could also facilitate the re-election of the rabble-rousers and those behind the disastrous situation in which the peace process now finds itself
That would indeed be absolutely deplorable
It is also why some countries have still not ratified the association agreement with the State of Israel
However in this case the situation is entirely different
It is worth giving more consideration to continuing scientific and technical cooperation especially as several Palestinian companies and universities are involved in this agreement
I am thinking in particular of Al Qods the University of Jerusalem and the University of Bethlehem
They will benefit from participating in it and this is also something that we must monitor
Moreover penalising universities or the high technology sector which on the whole are avid supporters of peace would probably amount to targeting the wrong enemy
Finally an agreement such as this is not only an agreement or a matter of charity it is also and this must be pointed out a means of returning to prosperity through exchanges
This all means that there are varying opinions within the Group of the European Radical Alliance
Many of us will perhaps abstain or will in any case either want to vote in favour or be tempted to do so
Mr President I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Quisthoudt on her excellent report and the speech she has just given
I entirely agree with her and my group will also be supporting her position
In an increasingly global economy and with growing competition cooperation between European partners in the fields of research and technology is no longer enough
Scientific and technological cooperation between the European Union and third countries and the involvement of third countries in the framework programme help to promote knowledge and technology transfers and innovation in the European Union which is good for employment here and helps to strengthen the links between people in the partner countries and the Union
Such cooperation can also help to find solutions to the trade disputes that the Union sometimes has with its partners
The Liberal Group is therefore very much in favour of continuing scientific and technological cooperation with Israel
However we do not want it to use participation in the framework programme as a political instrument in the Middle East
There is no reason to block aid to its neighbours
The Union has good relations with those countries too and our aid to the Palestinians in particular is not producing the hoped-for economic development in the region because Israel sometimes frustrates our aid programmes
My group therefore hopes and expects that if Parliament delivers a positive opinion on scientific and technological cooperation Israel will clean up its act
I am hoping to see some positive developments in the Middle East
Mr President ladies and gentlemen we welcome the conclusion of scientific and technical cooperation agreements between the European Community and the State of Israel
We would nevertheless like to take advantage of this debate in order to express our concern
We are concerned because although a large proportion of Israeli research is dedicated to the civilian sector another part of it for which we do not have exact figures involves the military sector
With this in mind it is impossible to forget the plane crash involving a plane full of chemical and bacteriological weapons which claimed so many victims in the Netherlands
That brings us to a question I raised in this very House on an article in The Sunday Times which I actually thought was a hoax
The article claimed that Israeli researchers had tried to isolate genes specific to Arabs in order to be able to use bacteriological weapons against them
I did not receive an answer to this question but in the Israeli press the daily newspapers Haretz and Maariv also published the story and it has not yet been denied
We could therefore be dealing with the most extreme and most abominable type of racism ever experienced
As a result we would like to be convinced that these cooperation agreements are not going to contribute to such extremely dangerous research
We are in favour of the security of the State of Israel and we are aware of the threats that have hung over this young nation However Israel must understand the desire of the Palestinians to regain their land and their sovereignty
Therefore we would like Europe to do everything possible to ensure that a definitive peace agreement based on the recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people is finally reached
That is the necessary condition for peace in the region
Mr President Commissioner it has certainly emerged from the statements on behalf of the various groups that this is not a purely technical agreement but that there are many political aspects involved a point which the rapporteur made perfectly clear too
It is true that there have been voices in all the groups including the group to which I belong which have spoken against the conclusion of such an agreement at the present time
However it is my experience of foreign policy more than anything else which makes me think that the reasons against concluding the agreement are far more tenuous than those in favour of concluding it
Whenever anyone says that we need a few good cards in our hand to engage in diplomacy and that such agreements should be used for that purpose I can certainly endorse that argument
But if we in the European Union want to make our voice heard more clearly in Israel which we do and if we want to have more influence on the decisions taken by the State of Israel we have no option but to approve this agreement
We would forfeit any credibility as a negotiating partner and any possibility of bringing our influence to bear in Israel if we did not approve this agreement now
By so doing we shall not be endorsing the current government
The choice of government is a matter for the people of Israel
They will decide who should be prime minister and they will no doubt decide on the composition of the Knesset
The agreement will scarcely influence their decision
The present government could perhaps use our rejection of the agreement to illustrate how ill-disposed and hostile Europe is to Israel at heart which is not the case at all
The only reason for our heavy criticism of the present government is that it has done nothing to promote peace and has failed to do many things that it could have done
We do not know who the next prime minister will be nobody knows that today
Above all we do not know what the composition of the Knesset will be
That is why a postponement will achieve very little The same situation or even a far more difficult one may result from the elections
Things cannot become all that much easier given the abundance of parties and candidates
That is why it surely makes good sense to decide now
To my Palestinian friends and I do not hesitate to say that I have very many of them and am in close contact with them I should like to say here and now that precisely because we are developing ideas in Israel with Israel and for Israel because we are establishing cooperative mechanisms that can help to break the deadlock on the peace issue we in Parliament should and indeed must decide to ratify this agreement in order to maintain the common ground that can underlie and justify our continuing dialogue with Israel
For that reason the Palestinian people have a special interest in our approval of this agreement which I particularly as someone involved in foreign policy can certainly commend to the House
Mr President I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl because her report is quite outstanding and her presentation is a model of balance and synthesis
Of course we must ratify this agreement
The proposals to postpone it are extremely worrying because postponing the agreement would naturally mean changing the nature of the agreement
Excluding Israel from the first round of invitations to tender would amount to a virtually irreversible penalty and would make Israel into a lesser partner in terms of cooperation
This cooperation must be exemplary in all respects and it is of fundamental importance both in terms of scientific exchanges and in terms of developing our cooperation with all the countries in the region
It obviously augurs well that Israel is prepared to accept the participation of Palestinian Arabs in this project
I will conclude by saying that it is extremely worrying to see that some people are trying to postpone this cooperation
The combination of the extreme right and the extreme left is significant in this respect and it is clear that these attempts are due to the resurgence of old feelings of hatred that we would have hoped not to see here again
Mr President I will not respond to the attacks that were just made
I am a friend of Israel too
I even have family in Israel
However I think that the scientific cooperation agreement with Israel appears at first glance to be an essentially technical document that could stand in the way of the development of cooperation between universities and research institutes elsewhere in the Mediterranean
There is a risk that the adoption of this agreement could be seen as an electoral tactic and a positive sign for the Israeli Government which would be encouraged to continue blocking the peace process
The Palestinians are already under considerable pressure to abandon their decision to proclaim a Palestinian State on May 
Indeed some of that pressure comes from this House as we can hear
We must use all the means at our disposal to put pressure on Israel on Netanyahu government to respect its commitments
We have the ideal opportunity to do so by postponing the vote on this scientific cooperation agreement until after the Israeli elections
This would not in fact be the first time as in January Parliament blocked the scientific cooperation agreement so that Palestinian universities would be reopened at that time they had been closed for over two years
It was mainly due to this vote that the Israeli Government decided to reopen them
Why should we not repeat this approach in order to achieve some real progress in the peace process
Mr President I congratulate the rapporteur on her work
There are two aspects to this report
Firstly the technical aspect and here the agreement is sweet mutual benefit to the European Union and to Israel
The latter has a technological advantage in a number of areas biotechnology opto-electronics medical information technology and software development
The European Union can benefit from the knowledge that is available there
The Israelis also have skills in space technology and in the nuclear sector areas where I would have strong reservations about cooperation
This applies particularly to the nuclear sector ten years ago I spent some time outside Mordechai Vanunu prison in Gaza trying to visit him
He is of course still in jail
I would welcome the Commission putting some pressure on Israel to deal with that
I would reassure Mr Antony who has now left us that if anyone in Israel or for that matter in the Arab world was stupid enough to try and develop ethnic weapons they would be self-destructing in the sense that the gene pools of the Arabs and the Israelis are sufficiently close that it would be very difficult to identify or produce weapons that would not harm people on both sides of the divide
I hope that this can be a force for progress
I will certainly be voting in favour of the report as long as there is a commitment that we will not cooperate in the nuclear area
I certainly would not want to have any cooperation in the space sector and I agree completely that we should be encouraging Israel and putting pressure on the Israelis to cooperate with the Palestinians in their research programmes
Finally I hope that we will make sure that none of this money goes into parts of Occupied Palestine
That would be a provocation and the European Union would have some responsibility for that
Mr President I would also like to express my thanks for this report especially for the conclusions that are drawn in it and above all for its desire to support the peace process by means of cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian research bodies
The problem with this agreement is that no mention is made of cooperation between Palestinian research bodies
The rapporteur says in her introduction that after the agreement has entered into force and after it has been in operation we shall make an assessment of the extent to which different Palestinian centres have been given the opportunity to participate
This would appear to me to be a rather absurd way of drafting an agreement if one wishes to achieve a given objective surely one would normally include that objective in the agreement
This aside I would very much like to endorse Mr Holm request that we should do something for Mr Vanunu I also believe that we must address the question of obliging Israel to sign a non-proliferation agreement as far as nuclear weapons are concerned
Mr President Commissioner rapporteur ladies and gentlemen as the chairman of the Delegation for relations with Israel I would like to welcome the fact that our colleague Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl has proposed that the new scientific and technical cooperation agreement between the European Union and the State of Israel be approved
As many people have pointed out this morning this is the result of particularly effective joint work since joint projects have received subsidies amounting to a total of more than ECU million
It is also the proof of real cooperation between the European Union and Israel and as we are well aware it has considerable technological and intellectual benefits for both parties
This is a clear example of how a balanced partnership should work
It is actually helping the peace process in the Middle East and we make no secret of this
In fact the agreement will lead to further joint work with Palestinian researchers laboratories and universities
And the Israeli authorities have made commitments to this end
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur very sincerely to thank all our colleagues in the Committee on Research Technological Development and Energy and of course to express my agreement with the very strong proposals made by Mr Stockmann
A few weeks away from the Israeli elections I would personally like to see in our decision which I hope will be a positive one a strong signal to those in the region with intelligence and spirit in favour of a peace based on development progress mutual respect and partnership
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would first of all like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur and to the Committee on Research Technological Development and Energy
They dealt with this issue in a very short space of time and almost unanimously support the conclusion of the scientific and technical cooperation agreement between the European Community and the State of Israel
The Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament is now able to make a decision on this matter
In the Union and Israel signed a scientific and technical cooperation agreement for the duration of the fourth framework programme
Israel thus became the first and currently the only non-European country to be fully associated with the Union research activities
What has this cooperation become today
As has just been mentioned it has led to around joint projects and these have produced results that are already visible
New products and practices have been developed for example a high-performance camera for medical imagery and a rapid photo-printing machine to mention but two
All these projects are based on partnerships that combine their complementary skills and the institutions of the two parties involved draw considerable benefits from them in terms of knowledge but also in economic and commercial terms
The association between Israel and the Union is firmly based on the principal of mutual benefit which is applied to each project
Israel population is among the most educated in the world
It could be looked on as an example from which we could learn a great deal
This is due to its extremely advanced technological know-how the dynamic nature of its small and medium-sized enterprises and its innovation policy which makes it the second leading country in the world in terms of the number of start-ups that are generated as a result of cooperation between universities laboratories businesses and financial organisations
Moreover I have visited the country on several occasions to see what progress was being made
Israel has become a partner that is very much in demand and highly valued by European consortiums
All the evidence shows that the participation of Israeli institutions brings a considerable added value to our programmes
I would like to add that insofar as the agreement guarantees reciprocity European researchers also have access to Israeli programmes
The agreement has fulfilled all its promises
The two parties have therefore expressed their desire to continue and to strengthen their cooperation for the duration of the fifth framework programme
The Israeli authorities would like this agreement to be implemented as quickly as possible
In fact Israel would suffer if there were a delay with respect to the agreement entering into force as happened with the previous agreement
With this in mind the Commission and the Israeli authorities completed the negotiations in the record time of three weeks
Nevertheless certain Member States are reluctant to bring this to a rapid conclusion and link the approval of the agreement to the progress of the peace process in the Middle East
On the contrary I think that the development of scientific and technical cooperation could make a significant contribution to the peace process
As the rapporteur points out it is important from this point of view for Israeli and Palestinian research institutes to be able to strengthen their cooperation
Some speakers have spoken on this subject and I would like to reassure them
This work has already begun and such cooperation will be particularly encouraged within the framework of the international section of the fifth framework programme which gives priority to actions in the Mediterranean region
Above and beyond its intrinsic interest cooperation between the Union and Israel in research is part of a broad political perspective
This is an additional reason for concluding the agreement to associate Israel with the fifth framework programme as soon as possible
Finally the Commission will continue to keep the relevant committees regularly informed of the progress of the negotiations
In order to respond to certain speakers I would like to say that the Commission believes that rather than encouraging regrettable abuses the renewal of the scientific and technical cooperation agreement aims to maintain dialogue within a specific sector and with a population that should be supported
We must not turn this agreement into a political challenge as the effects of this would be counter-productive
I would like to add that the agreement does not cover nuclear research even of a civilian nature nor of course does it cover the military sector
The Commission wishes to encourage cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian research institutes as I have already said
In order to achieve this it will use all the possible actions provided for in the fifth framework programme for the Mediterranean countries
One very specific area that comes to mind is that of water management
This is naturally an extremely important field as it is vital for bringing together populations that may be in a conflict situation
Israel recent policies in certain respects have shown regrettable shifts
However as regards the measures contained in this agreement given that the peace process is facing certain obstacles we cannot add to those problems by suspending cooperation with a scientific community that is among the most brilliant in the world As has already been mentioned its members are in favour of peace and some of them are even very actively involved in the peace process
We should not punish those people
On the contrary we must try to help them support them and continue to hold dialogue with them in the interests of the people
If we do not the people will be directly penalised by our reservations
We must show that we are open and generous although that must not prevent us from being aware of any possible shifts in Israeli policy
However I do not think that we should join these two elements together in order to use this scientific and technical cooperation agreement as a bargaining chip
It is a good agreement it has a certain symbolism and it has considerable political implications
It tries to take the best of both scientific communities in order to make things easier for the people there who are going through difficult times
We must learn to appreciate better their skills courage nature and great intelligence and become aware of how much we have in common with them
Thank you Commissioner

The vote will take place at am
Ship-generated waste and cargo residues
The next item is the report A by Mr Lagendijk on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the proposal for a Council Directive on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues CSYN
Mr President I should like to begin by congratulating the Commission on its proposal which I feel is a successful attempt to combat the pollution that is still being caused by vessels dumping their waste at sea
The approach adopted here is in my view and that of the Committee on the Environment a balanced one in that vessels are required to deliver their waste and ports are required to build facilities to deal with it
So far so good
But you will not be surprised to hear that there were also certain points where the committee wanted to improve or tighten up the proposals
First of all and this is the most important point on which there was the most discussion as there probably will be in future there is the issue of payment
The Commission proposes that a substantial proportion of the costs of receiving and processing the waste should be paid by all those using the port
In my view this is rather too vague so we have tabled an amendment to replace the word substantial by % of the costs
Why
Because I think it is extremely important to prevent ships from having a financial incentive to dump their cargo or cargo residues at sea outside the port
If only a small part of the costs are shared in the port dues then there will always be an incentive for vessels to consider dumping their waste at sea
This is why we are in favour of replacing the word substantial by at least % not because we want to have a precise figure but because we simply want to make it clear that the processing costs are to be shared among all vessels irrespective of whether or not they use the reception facilities
The second point on which we think the proposal could be tightened up is the monitoring of compliance
This operates on two levels
First monitoring at ports of call
If a vessel for some good reason does not have the time or the opportunity to deliver its waste at a particular port it must not be free to do likewise at the next port
It must be possible and it is already possible for ports to inform each other about the situation of vessels sailing to and fro between them or calling in at subsequent ports
The systems are already in place but they need to be further developed which is why we are calling on the Commission to support efforts to do this
Another aspect of monitoring concerns inspections within ports and here too we were a little unhappy with the rather vague wording used by the Commission which says that a sufficient number of such inspections must be carried out
Instead of this we would prefer to use a figure which the Commission itself suggested in earlier regulations so that % of all vessels must be inspected
This figure is already included in a number of regulations
The Commission has said that it may be dropped but at the moment we do not feel that there is any reason not to go ahead with this so as far as we are concerned the directive should contain the reference to %
The third change to the Commission proposal concerns fishing vessels
The Commission itself has admitted that it was a mistake that its proposal excludes all fishing vessels
We do not want to create unnecessary red tape so we are not in favour of bringing all fishing vessels within the scope of the directive but it seems too stupid for words that huge vessels like factory ships which generate enormous quantities of waste should be excluded from the rules
This is why we have proposed to exclude vessels under metres and include vessels over metres
The fourth improvement concerns rewarding environment-friendly behaviour which we feel is an important part of any environment and transport policy
We should be in favour of rewarding vessels that do their best to encourage environmentally friendly work practices on board or in dealing with waste
To do this we need to make it clearer exactly what an environment-friendly ship is which is why we urge the Commission to support the attempts being made to produce a more detailed definition
My conclusion and this is perhaps more of a comment on EU proposals in general is that all too often the Commission and sometimes Parliament too put forward proposals that are difficult to implement because they do not correspond to the situation in practice
I am convinced that the Commission proposal with Parliament amendments does correspond to the situation in practice
There are ports which already have reception facilities or are planning to build them
Vessels are prepared to deliver their waste
There are plans to produce better definitions of what environment-friendly vessels are
It is precisely because these plans are already being made and the proposal dovetails with them that I think the Commission proposal is a necessary useful and viable attempt to prevent the dumping of waste at sea
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen when the British Presidency put marine pollution on the agenda following quite a few requests from the Committee on Transport and Tourism among others there were many of us who said At last
And I mean this quite sincerely
We have witnessed many accidents involving oil in European waters
We have witnessed many ships that have spilt oil in our waters
This directive imposes obligations on the ships
We are moving from a convention an IMO convention which was a recommendation to legislation whereby we oblige the vessel and its master to give an account of any oily waste that may be on board
In addition we shall be obliging the ports but not necessarily all ports to receive waste oil
In my opinion it is essential that this directive should be made as functional as possible
It must not be difficult or bureaucratic
I hope that in the final version the Commission and the Council find a model that makes this directive workable and attractive for the ships and the ports
There are two problems The rapporteur has touched on one of them
There are two problems that I would like to address
Of course it must be paid for
Of course it is not free of charge I hope that these costs will not become yet another restriction on shipping
After all the short-sea report clearly demonstrated that port charges are one of the contributory reasons for choosing other forms of transport
So the small coaster or the large coaster for that matter will certainly incur a charge here and I consider this to be a problem
If one were to regard this as infrastructure it would be possible to make it free of charge
It is also possible to look at it from the point of view of the waste oil that is brought ashore
Surely this can actually be recycled and used
If one were to exempt it from oil taxes VAT and so on then it could actually finance this system
I think that we should come up with some good ideas with regard to this question of financing and present them to the Member States
Ships in transit in international waters that do not call at European ports are a different matter
After all we do not get hold of them I feel that we should think back to what happened with the Pallas Athene 
Here we have a vessel which bursts into flames in international waters drifts through Danish territorial waters and ends up on German territory and there we all are sitting down together and playing a kind of official pick up sticks
The first ones to make a move lose the game since it is they who pick up the bill
If we had had a monitoring system in the North Sea we could have intervened collectively Denmark the United Kingdom and Germany but we did not
We allowed the bill to be passed on to the place where the ship ended up
I therefore believe that it is also our job to get the Member States to take ships in transit into account in their deliberations on future policy
I am well aware that this is not covered by this directive
Mr President let me express my thanks for the preceding remarks and extend a special welcome to my honourable colleague the Transport Commissioner
I am delighted that we have been given another rare opportunity to discuss this matter in the morning rather than at oclock on Tuesday night
But let us turn to the business in hand
I believe that the Commission has adopted an excellent approach in the directive
As a native of Hamburg I am pleased to see that it incorporates all the results of a European international conference on the issue of port waste-discharge facilities which was held in Hamburg
Practice has shown us of course that the Marpol Convention with its discharge requirement for ships is inadequate
We must ensure that the waste on board ships is actually discharged
If we say here that the ports must provide discharge facilities and that everyone will have to pay anyway under a no-special-fee system I believe that more captains will decide to use the port discharge facility since they have paid directly for it in their harbour dues
This is a very important issue because we have no other way of cleaning up our beaches especially those on the North Sea and Baltic coasts
We still have a lot to do here but the same can be said for the Mediterranean and other parts of the European Union
The approach then is exactly the right one
I thank Mr Lagendijk who is a new member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism for his excellent cooperation
I believe the committee adopted the recommendation unanimously and it is a good thing and to be applauded that all the groups in this House are pulling in the same direction on this occasion promoting environmental protection without neglecting economic interests
Allow me to deal briefly with two more points
We have tabled a number of amendments and I hope the Commission will be able to approve them all Mr Kinnock
At any rate I should like to highlight two things First of all the Commission must be urged to ensure that the system of charges now being introduced does not distort competition between ports
It is to be expected that one port or another will try to offer a particularly attractive scale of charges or to obtain particularly large profit margins in order to secure a competitive edge in the usual conflict so to speak that occurs between ports over cargoes
The Commission must be watchful and we may have to beef up the legislation
I also believe as the rapporteur said that we must require Member States and ports to ensure that % of all ships are actually inspected every year
After all we are familiar with the problem of inadequate control from our experience with rest periods for long-distance lorry drivers We had to tighten up there because the Member States were not sticking to the rules
That Commissioner should not be a problem either since we have the same figure of % in the port state control directive
One and the same official may be able to carry out both types of check
We need effective control of waste discharge for the sake of the sea and for the sake of animal and human life
Mr President ladies and gentlemen the proposal for a directive that has been submitted to us responds to a perfectly commendable objective as it aims to ensure better protection of the marine environment
International rules do exist but everyone recognizes that they are not always respected far from it in fact
These international rules include the MARPOL Protocol and the proposal for a directive transposes its provisions into Community law These include reducing dumping at sea improving port reception facilities stepping up monitoring in order to force vessels to hand over their waste and establishing a system to fund these facilities
On the whole we can agree to this but the methods of implementing these objectives are of some concern and add to those we already expressed when considering the Green Paper on ports and maritime infrastructures
I would like to mention here the principle of subsidiarity
I would point out that the Maastricht Treaty does not give any particular powers to the European Union to organise the port system and the rules for managing sea ports
It would be unfortunate if the Union tried to interfere in that management through environmental issues
We should therefore ensure that the principle of subsidiarity to which my group is particularly committed is not called into question through such methods
With these reservations we approve and support the proposal for a directive as amended by the Committee on Transport and Tourism
To conclude I would like to commend the excellent work carried out by the rapporteur and congratulate him on the quality of his report
Mr President ladies and gentlemen people in civilised societies do not relieve themselves in the street The requirement that ships discharge their waste in port follows the same elementary logic
I believe that Mr Lagendijk report makes that perfectly clear
There must be no incentive such as the avoidance of special fees to circumvent that requirement
There must be a % inspection rate
Anything else will give rise to absurd or dangerous situations and the system must be weighted in favour of environmentally friendly vessels
Basically this report pussyfoots its way indirectly towards addressing three key points
The first is the question of a European maritime regulatory area
The United States has had one for a long time
The European Union continues to act as if it were a patchwork of small states between which only the IMO standards apply
That is an indefensible state of affairs
The second point is the need for control by the port state
This is an imperative of the first order given the development of flags of convenience and dual registration
The third point is the primacy of ecology since the destruction of our vital resources is certainly no basis on which to develop an economic activity
Mr President I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Lagendijk on his excellent work which it must be pointed out rightly deserved the unanimous approval of the Committee on Transport and Tourism
I fully agree with what was said by Mr Jarzembowski and would merely like to clarify a few points
As was mentioned the aim of this proposal on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues from ships is to reduce pollution and thus protect the environment in particular by monitoring the legal discharge of waste and other pollutants at sea
In this case the Commission proposal was a necessary and desirable addition to existing legislation on the protection of the marine environment and the creation of fair conditions of competition between the ports of the Community
We therefore welcome this opportunity especially the legal requirement for ships to dispose of waste and cargo residues in ports
The fee system proposed which comes very close to a no-special-fee system but avoids any downward pressure is to be welcomed in general terms
The proposal includes provisions that mean that ship-generated waste is treated slightly differently from cargo residues
Ships are required to deliver both types of waste in ports but under MARPOL rules in the case of cargo residues This means that the treatment and disposal of cargo residues are not covered by port charges but special fees could be charged for the process
I would like to end by saying that it is only natural that warships should be exempt from the provisions of the directive and generally speaking we support the proposal
Mr President we are all familiar with pictures of birds and fish fighting that final impossible battle against oil spills and other waste from our ships along our coastlines because the international conventions which prohibit dumping at sea are not being enforced
This situation will hopefully be remedied by this directive together with the amendments proposed by the committee whereby the ships must under all circumstances and regardless of the quantity of waste pay a port fee to dispose of their waste
Like the rapporteur we in the June Movement normally uphold the principle that the polluter pays
But we also agree with the rapporteur that in this case there is a need to depart from this principle since a fee which corresponds to the quantity of waste would make it tempting to dump the waste at sea
Control is the cornerstone of this directive
But in order for this to become effective the June Movement is urging that the amendments tabled by the rapporteur should receive particular support with regard to the following points that a definition should be found for the term environmentally friendly ship that the controls should be made more specific that the expression a substantial contribution should likewise be made more specific so that this becomes sufficiently large to ensure that it does not pay to dump at sea and finally that cargo residues should be covered by the port dues
Mr President it is in many contexts a major problem that waste from ships is not being managed in the proper way
The traffic through the Baltic Sea is a particular problem in this respect not least due to the extremely sensitive nature of this particular sea
Every year huge quantities of oil are discharged directly into the Baltic
In Swedish waters alone there are hundreds of discharges of this type every year
And it is virtually never possible to determine which vessel the oil has come from
In the light of this situation Sweden has a law which gives every passing vessel the opportunity to enter practically any port and dispose of its surplus oil there
Of course such a system has both advantages and disadvantages
Naturally a huge plus point is that this means that nobody will need to dump oily waste directly into the sea for purely economic reasons
At the same time however a system like this costs a great deal of money above all when there are only a few countries that apply the system
Given this situation it is a natural and obvious development to implement the same type of measures in a European context and also in my view to make the same demands of all the EU applicant countries
This would mean that within the near future practically all the countries situated around the Baltic would be subject to the same conditions with regard to the reception of such substances as oily waste
On this basis let me put a question to the Commissioner responsible what steps is he prepared to take in order to include the EU various applicant countries in today decision
Mr President I wish to begin by welcoming Mr Lagendijk report not only because it supports the Commission efforts to ensure a major reduction in marine pollution but also because it is his first as a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism I congratulate him on that
It is an accomplished piece of work if I may say so and in return for the support and the quality of the work I am very happy to say that the Commission can endorse many of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur
Specifically the Commission can accept at least the underlying principles of Amendments Nos and England France I thought I might get that in
There is however another set of amendments which the Commission must reject mainly on the grounds that it feels that the concerns expressed have already been dealt with in other parts of the existing text
I am sure that on further examination the honourable Members will understand and I hope accept that point
I refer specifically to Amendments Nos and 
That leaves just out of amendments where there is a more substantial degree of disagreement with Parliament and I must say that even in those cases the divergence is not fundamental
Amendments Nos and propose to extend the obligation to notify the onboard waste situation in writing to fishing vessels over metres
Mr Lagendijk referred specifically to this in the course of his speech earlier on
The Commission concern is that this could easily lead to an excessively bureaucratic system without bringing any substantial benefit to the environment
We should bear in mind of course that fishing vessels are not excluded from the requirement to deliver their waste in ports and to contribute to the cost of facilities
They are only exempted I emphasise this from the obligation to make a written notification before each port call
The reason for that is simply that most fishing vessels obviously have one or more standard ports where they normally land their catches
The prior notification proposal exists in order to allow the port to make the necessary arrangements for receiving waste from ships
In the case of fishing vessels the port will generally be very familiar with the needs of the vessels even without a written notification
We also believe that the length limit of metres like any other limit is bound to be somewhat arbitrary and therefore difficult to justify
For those reasons we hope that the House will accept practical reasons we cannot accept Amendment No either
Having said that however I share Parliament concern that if very big fish factory vessels were to be excluded from the statutory obligation that would be very retrograde
I should like to reassure the House that those vessels are definitely subject to the notification and control obligations since fish factory ships which are not engaged in catching fish are not considered to be fishing vessels under the terms of this proposed directive
The most controversial amendment as indeed Mr Lagendijk said is probably No on the charging system for the delivery of ship-generated waste
Here the objectives of Parliament and the Commission are absolutely the same all of us want to achieve a charging system in which ships are not given incentives to discharge waste at sea
However we differ about methods of securing that objective
The Commission proposal seeks to strike a balance between the need to make the best possible progress in encouraging waste delivery to ports and the plain political reality of taking into account the very different views of Member States on this issue
The end result of both Parliament and the Commission approach is that fees cannot only be based on actual delivery
Neither of us thinks that ships which do not deliver waste should be free from the fees associated with waste management
Our divergence therefore arises only from the fact that the Commission proposal preserves a greater flexibility for the Member States in deciding the extent to which the so-called no-special-fee system will be applied
In addition we should bear in mind that ports marinas and fishing ports in Member States are obviously very different not just between but also within Member States
As I said however the fundamental objective of sharing the cost between users and non-users is crucial if we want to encourage the delivery in ports of waste and reduce and indeed prevent the pollution of the sea
Amendment No is unacceptable because the Commission can adequately deal with competition matters under the powers it already has under the Treaty
The proposed amendment would have the effect of reducing those necessary powers merely to the possibility of making a proposal and that clearly would not be in order
Again I hope on reflection that amendment may be withdrawn
Finally we cannot accept Amendment No which relates to the number of spot-check inspections to be carried out for control purposes
The Commission considers that a certain flexibility is needed partly because of the potential future inclusion of the waste control regime in the existing port state control directive which obviously would have exactly the effect anticipated correctly by Mr Jarzembowski
Our feelings arise partly from the fact that the main elements for enhancing compliance with this directive are not only set down in the control part of the directive
The Commission therefore considers that a slightly less systematic spot-check system is adequate for the purposes of the directive and achieving the purposes of combating the pollution of the sea at least as far as checks outside the port state control regime are concerned
Clearly as Mr Jarzembowski said and as other Members have noted in the course of the normal port state control check it would be extraordinary if the inspector taking his % quota as it were were not to pay attention to the waste-disposal situation on board the craft
One could readily anticipate that will be undertaken it is a relatively simple check
One or two questions were raised by the honourable Members to which I should like specifically to respond very briefly
Mr Sindal raised the question of wrecks in international waters
We recall in this House that he has fastidiously pursued the questions raised by the disastrous wreck of the Pallas in international waters
Currently as the House and Mr Sindal know just vessels are the responsibility of the flag state but we are all aware of the deficiencies of that system and coastal states may get involved in order to protect their own environment
Clearly there is something to be desired in respect of using those powers as well
The House may be glad to know that the Commission is supporting discussions in the International Maritime Organisation about placing the mandatory responsibility for safeguarding against pollution and other effects of wrecks on the vessel owner
In my view that could be a very real breakthrough in our efforts to achieve quality shipping in all waters particularly in European waters
I hope that progress can be achieved without great delay in the IMO
Naturally we would prefer the standards to be global if that is at all possible and then followed up with a legal regime in our own maritime area
I hope we can embark upon that without great delay when the discussions are completed in the IMO
Further Mr Sindal also asked about VAT on waste disposal fees
That is a crucial question which is probably why discussions on the matter are still continuing
However in the course of the further development of this legislation I will be in a position to give a more specific response
Mr Jarzembowski point which is well taken that it is essential that the fees levied do not result in the distortion of competition between ports because their rivalry is to say the least very interesting
After I retire I propose to write a novel about this to do them real justice maybe a fairy tale who knows
There will be differences in the level of the charges which arise mainly because of the relative efficiency or inefficiency of the system
If a port because of its efficiency in handling waste disposal is able to charge smaller fees well the very best of luck to that port
What we are then seeing is effective competition and not a distortion of competition as I am sure Mr Jarzembowski will agree
I conclude by expressing my gratitude to the Committee on Transport and Tourism and specifically to the rapporteur Mr Lagendijk for the expeditious work and the excellent report on this detailed and important proposal
Thank you Commissioner
The debate is closed
The vote will take place shortly
Combined traffic dimensions and weights
The next item is the report A by Mr van Dam on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on
Ithe proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive EEC on the establishment of common rules for certain types of combined transport of goods between Member States CSYNIIthe proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive EEC laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic CSYN
Mr President combined transport is one way of reducing the negative effects of road freight transport the aim being to replace a considerable proportion of the road transport by water or rail transport
However the situation is disappointing combined transport accounts for only % of the total freight transported by road in spite of all the encouragement which Parliament has given
We must conclude from this that the efforts made up to now have failed to produce adequate results
For this reason the Commission initiative to improve the position of combined transport is certainly to be welcomed
It recognises that the existing policy has not achieved the desired results and proposes four measures to improve the current situation
First it broadens the definition of combined transport which now applies not just between Member States but also within one Member State
Second it proposes to reduce the fixed costs of road use
The road transport legs make less use of the infrastructure than other road transport so it seems reasonable to reduce the taxes paid
Third the Commission proposes an exemption from the bans on weekend driving for the initial and final road legs thereby reducing the total duration of combined transport operations
Finally it proposes to increase the permitted vehicle weight for lorries involved in combined transport to tonnes thereby enabling certain transport units to be operated to full capacity
The Committee on Transport and Tourism has a number of comments on the Commission proposal
First of all we agree with the broader definition of combined transport but it must be absolutely clear and leave no room for differences in interpretation
This is why we propose that the distance travelled by road in combined transport operations should be limited to % of the total journey
I should like to make the following points about the rest of the Commission proposal
The problems of combined transport can largely be put down to variations in the services provided by the railways and the high transshipment costs which combined transport inevitably involves
The question is whether a permanent solution can be found which does not involve a structural approach to these two factors and any new policy has to get to grips with them
This is why the Committee on Transport and Tourism supports the plans to offset the high transshipment costs at least partially by reducing or reimbursing the tax paid by lorries
The Committee on Transport does not agree with the proposal to exempt the road transport legs of combined transport from the ban on weekend driving as this will distort competition between combined transport and road transport
Parliament is trying to create a level playing field for the various forms of transport so such distortions are not what we want to see
The proposal would also bring disadvantages for the public since freight transport on main roads would increase at weekends
It would come up against the same objections that have been raised in connection with harmonising the restrictions on weekend driving
The Committee on Transport and Tourism also does not support the proposal to allow exemptions from the maximum permitted sizes and weights
This would first of all undermine the generally accepted tonne limit established in order to prevent damage to the infrastructure
Allowing tonne lorries means putting the infrastructure under greater strain and the high costs of this make it unacceptable particularly in view of the accession of the Central and Eastern European countries
It would be the first step towards a general tonne limit which is by no means desirable for the reasons I have described
We also have to ask whether higher vehicle weights really serve the best interests of mankind or the environment
In conclusion as the present rapporteur I should like to thank Mr Wijsenbeek for the work he did as rapporteur in the earlier phases of this report
I think that a collective day of rest is essential if society is to operate successfully which is why I am pleased that the retention of the ban on weekend driving prevents another group of workers from having to lose their hard-earned rest day on Sunday
I therefore commend these proposed amendments by the Committee on Transport and Tourism to the House
Mr President ladies and gentlemen a word of thanks first of all to Mr van Dam who stepped into the breach for Florus Wijsenbeek who for very honourable reasons handed back the report
If I sense the mood correctly the House will reject the report when it is put to the vote or at a subsequent stage and with good reason too
But why
After all we agree on the aim of promoting combined transport because we want to see the transport of goods shifted from the roads to the railways and waterways
So we agree on the aim
The question is whether the solution proposed here by the Commission is a suitable means to that end
I believe it is an unsuitable means I believe it is counter-productive
When the Commission proposes in Article a that goods vehicles be exempted from all restrictions on traffic movements that may be applicable at weekends at night on public holidays or in the event of heavy atmospheric pollution provided they constitute combined transport within the meaning of Article this would open a Pandora box which we cannot endorse
In other words as well as thetonne trailer combination that we have consistently rejected in Parliament another adverse development is being permitted here allowing almost anything to run on our roads as long as it operates in the name of combined transport
That cannot be our line
We are willing to negotiate about precise times and routes in this Parliament too but this blanket clause this carte blanche cannot be in our interests
It is the wrong way to proceed
That is why the Commission must think again on this in order to come up with a better proposal
Mr President ladies and gentlemen in view of the shortness of time I can only state that we essentially agree with the Socialists and in particular with the rapporteur
We do not want to promote combined transport in this way
We are in favour of promoting it by offering tax relief
But lifting the bans on night driving and weekend driving and increasing the maximum permissible weight are unsuitable measures which in the interests of the people of Europe we must reject
Mr President I shall be very brief
I have seldom encountered a worse example of hypocrisy than what we are hearing this morning
How do people intend to achieve the modal shift if combined transport is not given any advantages
How is rail transport supposed to compete with road transport if large containers cannot be brought to the trains and we are therefore forced to accept the tonne limit
Trains run every single day including weekends and holidays but the freight has to be brought to them which will be impossible if we keep the ban on weekend driving in place
I would add that structurally speaking a total weight of tonnes or tonnes makes no difference to the infrastructure whatsoever
Mr van Dam who was the one who included this in the report is telling us a load of nonsense here
Mr President I too want to defend the Greens opposition to the Commission proposal
Taking up points made by those who have already spoken with the exception of Mr Wijsenbeek we believe it is crucial to keep road transport down to % and we cannot accept conditions which entirely favour road transport in every particular such as being allowed to drive at weekends
We think the road transport legs should be limited to a maximum of kilometres but an increase in the maximum weight to tonnes is unacceptable
In view of all this although this approach is obviously designed to promote combined transport we think it is just a means of making road transport easier
We shall suspend the debate at this point since it is now voting time It will be resumed this evening
Mr President I would like here to raise an issue that has led to the European Parliament being deluded
In his reply to Mr Donnelly question Wim Duisenberg the President of the European Central Bank said that the members of the board of the European Central Bank receive a salary that is ten per cent greater than that of the Members of the Commission
In Finland yesterday it was revealed that the Bank of Finland which belongs to the European Central Bank organisation pays Sirkka Hämäläinen who is on the board of the European Central Bank a pension of around EUR a month in addition
I believe there is reason to suspect that other members of the board of the European Central Bank receive such additional payments
I hope that the appropriate parliamentary committee will look into this matter and will not condone such immoral goings-on
I am sorry Mr Seppänen but that is not a point of order and I therefore cannot let you go on
Mr President yesterday when the President of Parliament was in the Chair I raised the point that Parliament had been besieged by demonstrating farmers and I asked the President if he would give us further information on the subject either yesterday or today after he had talked to them
I also asked if Mr Santer and the Commissioner responsible for farming would be present to report back to us on what had taken place between them and the demonstrating farmers
This is an extremely important matter
Farmers are also demonstrating in Greece
I would like to know whether we are going to have a statement from the Commission today or not
We take note of what you say and no doubt the Commission will also have heard your comments
We shall now move on to the votes
VOTES
Mr President with regard to the legislative resolution I would request that we do not vote on it so as to comply with the procedure that has been adopted for all the reports on Agenda 
As I have the floor for a moment I would like to take this opportunity to thank all my colleagues for the vote and to inform them that I have analysed the Commission position on each of the amendments that were tabled and adopted
I noted with great satisfaction that the Commission has accepted half of the amendments adopted in the Committee on Agriculture
Nevertheless there are naturally differences on some points that were considered to be fundamental by the majority of the members of the Committee on Agriculture
I will defend these points in the meetings we will hold with the Council and the Commission up until the vote on the legislative resolution
Applause
I therefore put to the vote the proposal by Mr Martin that the vote should be postponed pursuant to Rule 
Parliament decided to postpone the vote and the matter was deemed to have been referred back to committee
Mr President I just wanted to inform you that in the official gallery there is a delegation from the parliament of Taiwan led by Mr Lee and Mrs Song
Loud applause
I therefore welcome the delegation from Taiwan
Mr President the report on which we are about to vote the White report is in my view the most important report for the physical territory of many countries of southern Europe and even for European agriculture
Since it is likely that there will be few Members here for the vote this evening I would ask you along with the rapporteur and our colleagues here to agree to postpone the vote on this report to the next part-session in Brussels to be held in days time
Mr President I am acutely aware of the problems presented to the Iberian peninsula by the issue of water
In view of what has just been said I do not object to what is proposed
Mr White and Mr Aparicio the decision will have to be taken in due course at the beginning of the vote
You can ask then for the vote to be postponed if you so wish but as things stand at present the vote is on the agenda for today at pm
The Swedish Social Democrats are of the opinion that wine bearing in mind the health aspects is not a product which should be supported by the Union common agricultural policy
Our view is therefore in principle that this support should be stopped
We are voting against the common organisation of the market for wine because it falls outside the whole existing CAP framework
The financial envelope allocated to this COM is insignificant compared to the amount earmarked for meat cereals milk and tobacco
Contrary to what happens with those COMs wine producers will not be entitled to any direct aid
The permitted planting areas cannot sustain a self-sufficiency policy for the European Union with % of trade already in the hands of third countries
Despite the Union campaign to ensure transparency for the consumer the COM does not make it compulsory to list the ingredients used to produce the wine on the label leading to unfair competition between wines containing sugar and those produced from grapes alone
The COM seeks to distinguish liqueur wines from naturally sweet wines thus adding to the fiscal burden on them and creating unfair competition between port and Madeira wines
The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the Martin report because it rejects large parts of the Commission proposals for a reform of the organisation of the market in wine
We support the Commission proposals since the reform is in line with the thinking behind Agenda 
The Commission has proposed that the wine sector should become more market-oriented so as to achieve a better balance in future between supply and demand
The proposed arrangements therefore mean an adaptation of the market which in turn means reorganisation and bans on replanting of wine areas in certain regions together with the abolition of artificial outlets for products that cannot be sold on the market
This avoids surplus production which is marketed at prices far below the costs of production and distillation
The Martin report paves the way for a dilution of the Commission proposals by retaining part of the distillation arrangements which the Commission proposes should be abolished and imposing longer timescales for the individual objectives and this we cannot endorse
The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations voted in favour of almost all of the amendments that were adopted in the Committee on Agriculture as they reflected our position
During the debate on the Martin report in the House Commissioner Fischler made a speech in which he expressed views that were contrary to the interests of French and European wine growing
With regard to the ban on importing musts from third countries for wine making Commissioner Fischler said that he disagreed with the European Parliament position basing his argument on the WTO agreements and stating that suitable labelling regulations would be introduced
The amendment as adopted in the report reflects the very same current legislation that was consolidated in the GATT
Our group does not therefore understand Commissioner Fischler views and is opposed to the introduction of specific labels for wines made from musts imported from third countries
The wine will be promoted according to where it is made so the final product will have the designation of origin of the place where the wine was made in line with the GATT agreements
As far as planting rights are concerned the Commissioner says that he still favours limiting the growth of European vineyards to % in the period
The European Parliament wanted % growth in order to enable vineyards with structural problems to adapt to their market without relocating from regions of production where the product is less highly valued
In terms of the restructuring of vineyards the Commissioner said that he was in favour of this measure because it fulfilled the objective of quality
Nevertheless he remains opposed to our proposals on the regeneration of vineyards and the improvement of wine-making facilities
Once again the Commission approach is too restrictive and does not embrace the real economic situation of the wine-making industry
What is the use of altering the quantity of vine stocks in a production region without altering its winemaking facilities
How do we plan to alter the vine stocks in an area of designated origin
The Commission proposal is therefore going to limit the qualitative improvements of the qwpsr and table wines with geographic designation
I must point out that these are products that are exported by the European Union and that therefore contribute both to the development of rural regions and to the balance of trade in the wine-producing Member States
As regards the promotion measures the Commissioner stated that they would be subject to a horizontal regulation that is one that is valid for all so-called quality agricultural and food products
I must point out that only eight of the European Union fifteen Member States produce wine
It is highly probable that of the financial resources to be used for this horizontal regulation the majority will be used for agricultural and food products that are produced in all the Member States of the European Union such as milk products and meat products
However I was pleased to note that the Commissioner took account of all the amendments tabled by Parliament on trade organisations
In France we are aware of the fundamental role of professional organisations
They need to have a legal status that is specified in Community law in order to ensure that they are not called into question by the non-producing Member States on the premise of the single market and competition
As a Member from the Languedoc-Roussillon region I welcome the fact that we were able to reintroduce the definition of natural sweet wines into the Commission proposal
However I regret the fact that certain French pressure groups wanted to remove this definition purely for tax reasons
In conclusion I was pleased to see that some of our proposals were taken over by the Commissioner
However once again all the measures that we envisaged in relation to revitalising supply and demand with regard to both the single market and third countries have been rejected by the European Commission
I must point out that the European Union is the world leader in terms of wine making and alone accounts for % of world trade in this sector
Rather than trying to preserve this dominant position on the world market the Commission is taking an approach that puts constraints on the European wine-making industry
I want to use this explanation of vote to express my support for the report by Mr Martin on the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine This reform is essential and aims to adapt the sector to the current situation and to the high degree of competition in the global market
We need to establish a better and more complete system of Community aid and support for those wine-growing zones that are both in crisis and expanding due for the most part to increasing competition from third countries
In this respect the Commission must provide greater protection for quality wine through the designations of origin system both within the EU itself and in international agreements with third countries
A comprehensive policy to combat the crisis in the wine sector must aim to ensure that vineyards do not relocate to areas receiving EU subsidies
In this respect the Commission must allow the sector to be cofinanced at national level Moreover we must not consider wines made with grapes from third countries to be Community wines as the Commission proposes since they would therefore be eligible for subsidies
It is also essential to increase to % the area for new planting up to 
The organisation of the market in wine is from start to finish an absurdity that would make the Soviet Gosplan planning authorities green with envy
Moreover support for wine amounts to an irresponsible waste of taxpayers money which not infrequently is actually embezzled
In spite of this it is proposed to increase the support from around EUR billion per annum to around EUR bn ie from some SEK bn to SEK bn a year
We believe that this form of organised swindle involving EU funds should be phased out as quickly as possible
Wine is not a foodstuff but a luxury item which should be subjected to the laws of the marketplace without any further intervention from central authorities apart from any steps that might be justified for reasons of alcohol policy but these would need to be effected at Member State level not EU level
If for social reasons the wine-growing countries wish to support their growers then of course they have every right to do so but to make taxpayers contribute in this way over and above what they pay to purchase the wine is nothing short of grotesque
It is hard to imagine a more flagrant example of misdirected pseudo-solidarity than support for wine
We are in favour of genuine international solidarity including increased foreign aid
This is one of the reasons why we have voted against the report as a whole
Wine producers are farmers and must therefore be entitled to EU support in the same way as other farmers
However EU support must be changed and become more of an environmental support and focused more on smaller agricultural holdings
In the long term the support needs to be reduced
It is wrong to include such a large number of detailed provisions in the report
I have abstained from the final vote
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the European Parliament has not gone along with the Commission proposals but has devised a counter-project as it were thereby eliminating some obvious weak points in the Commission text and has tabled a compromise proposal
The important thing is to preserve wine production in Europe attaching special priority to quality products
In particular it will be essential to safeguard the diversity of traditional production methods many of which go back thousands of years
That is why it is incomprehensible that some of my fellow Members keep trying to fan the flames of north-south discord over winemaking processes
The north does not find fault with southern production methods so the MEPs from southern climes should not oppose typically northern methods either
The message here is Live and let live
Wine is a natural product which taken regularly and in moderation is beneficial to health
This has been proved by a number of scientific analyses
I should like to refer in this context to a recent study conducted by the University of Mainz which clearly demonstrates that daily consumption of one to three glasses of wine protects the heart and reduces the risk of coronary thrombosis
In my opinion it would be appropriate to advertise these findings as part of a series of large-scale European wine campaigns
Initiatives to this end should be supported by the European Commission
They would also serve to refute explicitly the recurrent false reports according to which the Commission intends to prohibit the advertising of alcoholic products
Again and again and again one regulatory frenzy after another from the European Commission
In for example a set of market regulations for wine was adopted and remained in force until 
Then came new market regulations for wine but these were originally devised for France Germany Italy and Luxembourg only
The accession of Greece Portugal and Spain made the problems greater and as time went by we had a growing surplus of table wines which had to be brought under control
The Martin report is therefore of great importance to Luxembourg wine growers too
Who does not remember the epic discussions on the two wine reports by our honourable colleagues Mateo Sierra and Julio Fantuzzi
Two worlds were pitted against each other the wine-growing areas of the south and those of the north
Although the Fantuzzi report was adopted by a slender majority it did not attract majority support in the Council of Agriculture Ministers
The Moselle and our winegrowers once more emerged relatively unscathed because the Commission pessimistic forecasts of wine production and consumption proved to be inaccurate
Almost five years after the Fantuzzi report Parliament has to deal again with a proposal from the Commission on the common organisation of the market in wine
And at this point I should like to congratulate Mr Martin as a specialist in this field for the good report he has tabled and especially for its fairness
In the expectation that the report will achieve a majority in both Parliament and the Council this time let me say that the compromise amendments he has tabled will enable the wine growers of the northern vineyard regions to go on producing their quality wines just as they always have done
In any case I believe that the production of quality wines in the European Union falls under national jurisdiction by virtue of the subsidiarity principle and that Luxembourg still produces some of the best of those wines
Our aim must be to achieve a decrease in the production of table wine and to prevent the importation of must from non-EU countries
Above all there must be a reduction in large-scale distillation in other words the organised destruction of wine before it reaches the market
I shall therefore be voting for Mr Martin report and I do so in the hope that producers in all wine-growing areas will be spared any further rules and regulations in future
I would first of all like to commend the exceptional quality of the work that has been done in the context of this detailed study of the importance of activities linked to wine in our societies
This is due to the professional experience of the rapporteur combined with the best possible knowledge of the subject that came from the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations and the study carried out on the ground by the writers of the report on the basis of contributions from producers and in close cooperation with our Directorate-General for Research
This debate brings to light several fundamental points dealing with both the nature of the common agricultural policy and the actual running of the European institutions
At the centre of our concerns is the desire to clearly affirm that wine is an agricultural product and not an industrial one
It is essential to take this position as it conveys the need to maintain a genuine close and rigorous link not only in terms of marketing between the land and the product
It also implies the desire to encourage the promotion of products on the basis of the place of production
Respecting this link between the land and the product is essential to ensure consumer safety
It is a necessary condition for the future of food safety and also for the possibility of maintaining balanced land-use planning
It enables us to prevent destructive concentrations and to continue to develop the production of food from the land which is part of our culture
In order to maintain this link we must prevent the development of a dangerous shift that is the possibility of making wine from musts imported from third countries
Our colleague Mr Chesa who comes from one of the most important wine-making regions in Europe rightly highlighted the risks of a reduction in quality and of breaking the link between product and land that this move would entail
Parliament has proposed banning wine making with musts from third countries
However Commissioner Fischler argued that this position was not well-founded considering that the provisions of the Marrakesh agreement establishing the WTO no longer allowed the countries of the European Union to declare such a ban
We in turn contest Mr Fischler interpretation as the proposals in the Martin report merely take up the exact provisions of the COM in wine which are consolidated in the GATT
I have moreover addressed a written question to the Commission on this fundamental point and this must be clarified quickly
Rather than taking the relevant step of encouraging the development of a sector in which European countries are world leaders the Commission has adopted a Malthusian restrictive and cautious attitude towards several issues
Fortunately the Martin report deliberately breaks away from this philosophy by rightly proposing a controlled restructuring and regeneration of vineyards and measures to improve the quality of grapes and wine-making facilities
It also gives priority to structural measures to help and support young people when they are setting up their operations and as they expand
Finally the Martin report quite rightly requests that the Council authority and rights be entirely preserved in this important sector while the Commission proposed as usual an excessive increase in its own powers claiming that it alone held all the powers of modification and regulation
We can only hope that the Council which is the only European institution that has real democratic legitimacy will be able to resist the pressure from the Commission
The Alleanza Nazionale is voting in favour although personally I am only partly satisfied
I think reform of the organisation of the market in wine must essentially respect the following principles
Although market regulation mechanisms are needed to balance supply and demand the Commission is not justified in extending the ban on new planting up to while permitting wine making from imported musts
While other world wine producers have a free hand this restriction represents a serious threat to the Union dominant position on the world market where Europe currently accounts for over % of total production-Maintaining the status quo on enrichment with sucrose to obtain the final alcohol content of wines is unacceptable
This kind of regulation would hinder the development of markets like Italy which focus on alcohol produced in vineyards rather than cellars
The significant cost-savings achieved by the simple addition of sugars would make quality production like Italy barely viable and condemn it to a niche position on the market-I also think it is important to regularise the position of the Italian vineyards planted without formally respecting Community regulations and I reject the Commission idea of deducting these from the new planting reserve
In fact if the Commission approach were accepted Italy would be at a distinct disadvantage compared with Spain which currently meets the provisions in the proposal-Finally under Commission Decision No EC of March the wine-growing sector should be included amongst those benefiting from aid for product transformation and processing
If Italian cellars cannot access European aid to invest in production technology it will be impossible to improve the quality of their products and entrepreneurs boasting one of the oldest wine-making traditions in Europe who accept the market logic of product improvement and are counting on penetrating the upper segments of the market will be penalisedBarros Moura report A
Mr President Mr Barros Moura report raises the issue of which European institutions and policies are needed to complete the transition to the single currency and enable it to function
It has not come too soon
This issue was deliberately avoided at Maastricht so as to facilitate the Treaty ratification and again at Amsterdam so as not to open debates that might have led to doubts among the citizens on the eve of the single currency entry into force
Nevertheless we are faced with the issue now and we must face up to it
The Barros Moura report opens up several debates but by no means all the debates
For example it does not thoroughly examine the issue of the democratic control of the single currency as this issue seems practically impossible to solve
It also fails to consider the issue of who will make the ultimate decision on external exchange rates because it is such a contentious issue at present
And even though it mentions the need for a federal-style budgetary system it fails to specify what this means in terms of new taxes and the rates they would be set at
In fact what does this report actually deal with
Essentially it deals with the coordination of economic policies which it would like to see extended to other related areas such as structural policies
This is something it would like to see become more centralised to the Commission advantage and more binding along with the obligatory decisions taken by a qualified majority
The socialist leanings of the rapporteur who views all solutions in terms of a superstate are clearly evident in all of this
Our Liberal colleagues appear somewhat taken aback by this prospect and yet the result was obvious
It is true that the choice has still not been formally announced between socialist or Liberal-style euro management institutions but in short that choice has been largely predetermined
The single currency is in itself a unifying and rigid principle something our Liberal friends seem to have realised a little too late
We would like to thank the rapporteur for the accomplished work that has been put into this important report
We believe that there is good reason to highlight the need for an effective consensus with regard to the policy on EMU and other policy areas such as employment and social policy the overall macroeconomic policy and environmental policy
We also believe that there is good reason to highlight the need for political control over the ECB within the framework of the independence demanded by its operations
The enlargement of the EU compels us to pay greater attention to these questions a point which is also emphasised in the committee proposals
However we feel that in several instances the committee proposals run the risk of tackling the issues from the wrong starting-point
The development of increased coordination between policies relating to EMU above all employment and social policies overall macroeconomic policy and environmental policy should be based on more active initiatives and more closely coordinated objectives in these areas rather than on static demands for changes in the Council decision-making procedures and the introduction of binding rules
In our opinion it is essential above all that the Community should increase its efforts to achieve more active employment and social policies and better coordination of overall macroeconomic policy
We believe that increased efforts cannot in all respects be driven primarily by institutional changes in the way that is proposed by the committee
In our view this is a valid position even in the context of enlargement
Furthermore we are of the opinion that changes in the rules for making decisions on economic policy should be based on clear definitions of which areas of the Member States current economic policy would be affected
We believe that some of the proposals for institutional changes that are being submitted by the committee do not take into account this need for clear definitions
One example of these essentially unclear definitions is the committee paragraph on federal-style budgetary systems
As regards the committee proposal of a legal basis in the Treaty for the Euro Council we believe that this fails to take into account the fact that EMU should be seen as a matter for all EU countries even those which are not currently taking part in the euro
EMU and the common currency have an impact on large areas of Community policy and should therefore not be a matter that is handled exclusively by the Euro Council as envisaged in the proposal put forward by the committee
This consideration has guided us in the position we have adopted on individual points in the report and the individual amendments that have been tabled
The fact that the report as a whole contains certain weaknesses does not mean that we believe it should be rejected in its entirety
The relationship between EMU policy and other policy areas and the consequences of enlargement for EMU are so important that this matter warrants further attention
The Barros Moura report sets the course in a clear and technically convincing way for the development of the EU in terms of the establishment of the internal market EMU and the euro
Consequently the next logical and inevitable step if a breakdown of the monetary union project is to be avoided is to establish a real federal structure
Amongst other things this means giving more power to the Commission and the European Parliament and less power first and foremost to the national parliaments
At the same time majority votes will be the norm
There will be a common economic policy and a common tax policy
In addition a federal-style budgetary system will be created a budget that will be used to resolve crisis situations in the individual Member States
To put it more directly the report is canvassing for the establishment of a federal state with a federal budget at its disposal similar to the federal system that exists in federal states such as Germany and the USA
As a counterbalance to EMU the report wishes to create a social and political union
The establishment of a social union will mean that a framework will be created at EU level for the way in which social security benefits and schemes are to be administered
The Union will establish parameters for determining who is entitled to benefit from the social security system how much they are able to receive and how the benefits and schemes are to be financed
We do not share the Barros Moura report vision of a federal EU and we are therefore voting against the report
The transition to the euro is the result of the political will demonstrated by the Union and its Member States
It was not an end in itself but simply one stage further along the road to European integration
The launch of the euro provides the Union with a single monetary policy which makes it necessary to restore some kind of balance particularly in the economic sphere
The ECB among other institutions now performs all of its tasks with full independence which is certainly a positive thing
However the absence of a genuine political authority in economic matters at the European Central Bank clearly places the issue of the lack of democratic accountability in European integration at the centre of the debate
It also gives rise to the fear of an uncompromising monetarist policy which would govern the Union strategic choices and be a burden for potentially healthy economic growth which is able to create jobs
Coordinating economic policies becomes a pressing need if we wish to promote an efficient and competitive European economy which as our resolution states is also able to generate jobs solidarity economic and social cohesion and equal opportunities between citizens of all the Member States
In order to attain this we now need to openly declare our commitment to an economic and social union as well as to define a new social contract that establishes the common principles in social matters
However this will not be possible if the development of an integrated economic policy is not accompanied by closer alignment of Member States tax systems
In short I very broadly share the conclusions reached in the resolution we are considering
I will support it all the more as it highlights the need to strengthen Parliament role in all matters concerning Economic and Monetary Union
Sadly I have to note that the scenario we feared will become a reality if this text is adopted We predicted that the existence of EMU would result in calls for harmonisation in areas such as taxation as well as employment and social policy
The Member States are in other words being asked to harmonise their economic policies which is one of the reasons why I voted against this report
EMU means more Union
Decisions on economic policy as well as interest and exchange rates become an EU-only affair
In the long term fiscal and financial policy will be decided at Union level too
A whole raft of reports from the European Parliament confirms this trend
EMU is an economic and political project the cornerstone of a future EU state
This report admittedly takes a relatively softly-softly approach but the underlying message is there
Economic policies are described in terms of issues of common interest
The report speaks of approximation of fiscal and social policy more qualified majority voting and a stronger Commission
The rapporteur calls for conclusion of the draft interinstitutional agreement on the coordination of national economic policies and on monitoring the stability and growth pact
Such measures would only increase the power of the EU and widen the democratic deficit
I therefore voted against this report
The rapporteur clearly views EMU as a platform for championing the transformation of the EU into a federal state
In the recitals to his report he uses formulations such as The European Parliament considers that the absence of a common economic and fiscal policy appears to be completely incompatible with the unified management of monetary policy or points out that establishing monetary union would require a federal-style budgetary system
EMU as an enterprise is fundamentally undemocratic
Yet the rapporteur erroneously hopes to remedy its shortcomings by granting increased powers to the European Parliament and allowing qualified majority voting in the Council on the general guidelines for the Member States economic policy
The EU should operate on the basis of intergovernmental cooperation
Accordingly unanimity must be the rule when Community-wide measures are decided upon It should be governments that appoint the president of the ECB and the Member States must be responsible for shaping national economic and fiscal policy
In the interests of the continued positive development of the EU it is necessary for economic and monetary union to be a success
Especially in the light of the prospective enlargement it has become even more important to ensure that the structure of EMU is as healthy and as effective as possible This can be achieved in part by providing for strict control of the economies of the participating countries
In my opinion it is important to ensure that a healthy balance exists between decisions taken at national and supranational level
Coordination of macroeconomic regulation is essential but it is important that the EU does not deprive the Member States of the responsibility which they are obliged to live up to as members of the economic and monetary union
The European Parliamentary Labour Party welcomes much of the Barros Moura report and the attention it pays to the political consequences of Economic and Monetary Union
However we have major reservations about some aspects of the report
In paragraph one second indent we cannot support the implication that social security must be harmonised to make EMU a success
If the President of the Central Bank is to enjoy the confidence of all Member States he or she should be appointed by consensus
We therefore voted against paragraph 
We are concerned about the proposals to extend QMV to the management of economic policy and voted against paragraphs and 
The proposal for a federal-style budgetary system in paragraph is also one we oppose
Paragraph calls for the Euro Council to be enshrined in the Treaty
This risks institutionally a two-tier Europe in which non-EMU Member States of the EU will be in some sort of second division
We oppose this
On the final report the position of the EPLP was to abstain
Mr Barros Moura focuses on a key problem connected with the current stage of European integration which can only be described as lopsided market radicalism Although we have a single European market a European currency and a European monetary policy we have no equivalent instruments of political union
There is not even an effective European exchange-rate policy at the present time which could position the euro strategically in relation to the other currencies of the world especially the dollar
To prevent any misunderstandings let me stress here that such a policy would have to be based on cooperation it must not mean an intensification of unbridled competition through government interference This lopsidedness that market radicalism has inflicted on the European integration process must be rapidly rectified as a matter of urgency
We need a Community exchange-rate policy that is worthy of the name a binding monetary dialogue among the Community institutions European economic governance as the basis of a Community macroeconomic policy and the effective development of Community policies and of coordination between the Member States policies in key areas such as taxation in the single market employment and the establishment of the social and environmental conditions in which fair competition can take place within the European single market These are the things we need in order to build up the general economic momentum that will drive us towards the goal of sustainable economic activity
In view of the effective new level of supranational and global interconnection in the business world the EU in pursuing its goal will always have to present a united front to the international community
But we can and we must make the first move here
Bourlanges report A
Mr President we believe that of all the European institutions the Council of Ministers and to a greater extent the European Council possess the greatest relative legitimacy because people see their elected representatives meet in these institutions at the highest level
No other European institution has achieved such status neither the European Parliament which is still considered to be a lower House nor of course the Commission which is considered to be a mere collection of civil servants
In the very interests of Europe attention must be focused on the most legitimate institution
Therefore the Council must be granted the right to propose legislation and exercise control over the Commission even censure it
Also decisions must be taken unanimously for all major issues
In this respect the Bourlanges report asserts that unanimity is an arrangement fundamentally inappropriate to effective decision-making 
In the explanatory statement the rapporteur presents some gloomy calculations showing that with players the probability of achieving a unanimous position is one in 
This is quite clearly wrong because in today Europe a great many decisions are taken every day by general consensus
In fact the system of unanimous voting forces each partner to respect the point of view of others and endeavour to understand that point of view in order to negotiate better
The decisions taken as a result are more valid because they are based on mutual consensus
It seems as though this system is perhaps somewhat slower than others that are more authoritarian in nature but it nonetheless produces good results
An enlarged Europe with or members should be able to operate in this way We also reminded you through an amendment that the Luxembourg compromise should be incorporated into all parts of the Treaty
Unfortunately that amendment was rejected
In any case we have to accept that a Europe with members cannot be monolithic and must obey the model of variable geometry
All of these measures including the variable geometry which will make decisions on European cooperation more flexible will strengthen the link between Europe and its nations
If the Union is to meet its goal of enlargement reform will need to extend beyond agricultural policy and the Structural Funds to embrace the whole process of decision-making
The report is therefore a welcome initiative
We do not however agree with the rapporteur proposals on the common and foreign security policy the CFSP
Our view is that the Council plays and should continue to play a central role with regard to the EU and the CFSP
We would refer to the political spirit underpinning Article of the Treaty of Amsterdam where it is stated that the Council shall be responsible for decisions in all areas affecting the Union security
The rapporteur paragraphs and are not acceptable in the light of this
We believe that the concept of positive abstention could be of assistance in fulfilling the Petersberg tasks humanitarian intervention and peacekeeping and peacemaking measures In our view however political will alone can equip the EU to be more active in crisis management
The outcome will hinge on how the new decision-making procedures work out in practice
We cannot therefore support paragraphs and 
We support the forward thinking in the Bourlanges report about the way the Council should operate in an enlarged European Union
In particular we support his call for better coordination and greater efficiency through increased use of qualified majority voting and above all the vital importance of returning to the Community method by re-establishing institutional balance with a strong Commission endowed with a real power of initiative and political drive
We have voted against certain points
The rapporteur limited definition of constitutional issues for which unanimity would be maintainedParagraph which would give qualified decision-making power in budgetary matters to the States contributing most This is at odds with the Community method and the principle of constitutional equality between the Member StatesOn the weighting of Council votes anything that goes beyond maintaining the current balances and might therefore encourage the concept of a directing board of the larger Member StatesAs in the previous points anything that might predetermine the position of the European Parliament on basic political and constitutional issues before the process of revising the Treaties beginsAnything that would make good anti-European propaganda in the coming election campaignOur final overall vote was determined by the outcome of the votes in the House on these issues on which thanks to our initiative and our efforts the PSE Group has adopted exactly the same approach
Given that some of these essential concerns of ours especially the weighting of votes in the Council have not been sufficiently safeguarded we have voted against
Before I make any comments I should like to congratulate Jean-Louis Bourlanges on the quality of his report and the relevance of his remarks
Without prejudice to the future of the Community institutions this text provides a particularly interesting basis for an excellent debate and moreover is proof of the maturity of this House if indeed that still needed to be demonstrated
As regards the comments made about the Council I share the rapporteur concerns and cannot imagine enlargement ever taking place without there first being a thorough reform of the present decision-making process
My greatest fear is to see a paralysed European Union and one that is incapable of giving impetus to a clear policy
Faced with the challenges of the next millennium we need a Council that is capable of setting out Europe central themes
I also think that the ability to do this is fundamentally incompatible with the present system of the rotating presidency which is why the question raised by Jean-Louis Bourlanges regarding the Council powers is important even if it is difficult to answer
As regards the way in which the Council of Ministers currently operates and following the rapporteur example I am actively campaigning for a rehabilitation of its role in my view it must be the Union driving force
Contrary to the report I would prefer to see the various ministers for European affairs engage in closer coordination with a view to achieving greater consistency in national and European policies
In accordance with the agenda the relevant minister should be in charge of the matter
Lastly as regards the system of procedures and more specifically the general principle of qualified majority voting I believe that this system should be extended
I am not opposed to the principle of the double majority which to me seems more fair and legitimate than the present weighting system
Indeed I also think that we need to begin debating the powers of the future European Commission within the context of the Union enlargement
Finally I should like once again to stress that enlargement cannot take place without there first being a change in the present institutional framework
This prerequisite is not in my view designed to hinder the process but on the contrary aims to establish the foundations of a political Europe that is able to take responsibility for the choices it makes
Jean-Louis Bourlanges has quite rigorously conveyed the expectations of our Committee on Institutional Affairs which has for a long time been calling for a radical reform of the Council role structure and modus operandi 
Without such reform successive enlargements will paralyse this central decision-making organ
During the discussion on this report my concern in thinking about European citizens was to extract clear principles from the recitals which will push the European project towards the objectives of our efforts and proposals
In my opinion this project is inextricably linked to an increased democratisation based on the principle of majority voting the political accountability of the authorities scrutiny on the part of parliamentary institutions and the transparency of decision-making procedures
The Union must progress towards a model which clearly reveals its dual nature as a union between Member States on the one hand and as a union between peoples on the other
In this model the Commission will become a genuine European executive with Parliament representing the people and the Council representing the Member States
This model of Europe will be able to act as an integrated whole which is both coherent and united thereby increasing its international influence
As this is an own-initiative report from the European Parliament my second concern relates to both the principle behind the report and the time chosen to adopt it
Generally speaking I appreciate the efforts made by Jean-Louis Bourlanges and in particular his attention to detail in the proposals
However I think that until the Amsterdam Treaty is ratified and implemented by the Member States it would often be appropriate to leave to the future negotiators the job of putting forward specific rules and limiting our role to simply announcing the general guidelines we are to follow
In this way we can be justified in our desire to see the double majority adopted in the long term as this is a guideline that the vast majority of the House can ratify
But we will not go into detail regarding percentages here as these should be studied at a later stage
I was pleased to note that the rapporteur had recommended that the weighting system be maintained until this double majority is adopted
However it would perhaps be somewhat restrictive and ill-advised to suggest that current percentages must be maintained
The most important thing is for the principle of equilibrium to be maintained chiefly between the larger and smaller countries
We should by all means clearly specify a guideline maintaining equilibrium but try to prevent divisions emerging by beginning a debate on quantification
As regards qualified majority voting in the majority of cases Jean-Louis Bourlanges intention to withdraw the resources that belong to the cases that are excluded from this type of majority gives rise to concern
Parliament already gave its opinion on this matter when it examined the Méndez de Vigo-Tsatsos report a report which expressed a balanced opinion and which was approved by the broad majority of Members by making an exception of constitutional and semi-constitutional matters in terms of qualified majority voting
In my opinion it would not be wise to go back on this agreement at the present time even if the term semi-constitutional poses a problem
With regard to the issue of foreign policy we are waiting for the Amsterdam Treaty to be both ratified and implemented before deciding whether or not to reject the idea of positive abstention
I think that opinions on this are divided even within the groups
Allow me to briefly sum up the approach that I advocate
At the present moment in time we simply express the principles that guide us which essentially means our desire to keep the balance but we avoid discussing details that might divide us
This approach is similar to the culture of minorities which leads to respect for others and rejects the abuse of dominant positions
For a long time it has been clear to those of us that are in favour of consolidated European integration that successive enlargements have brought European institutions to the edge of paralysis
Any further enlargements are likely to hamper a system which in its time has proved its worth but which was never designed to function with members and less still with or members
Before any further accession takes place European institutions must be reformed including the Council which has become tangled up in the growing multiplicity of its organs and takes more and more liberties with procedures that had however been determined in the Treaties
This is clearly an unacceptable situation
I fully share the rapporteur conclusions particularly where he affirms the need for a thorough reorganisation of the Council structure and role as well as the need to rationalise and consolidate procedures with a view to making it more efficient and transparent
I lay great emphasis on the role the rapporteur would like to see conferred on both the President of the Commission and the High Representative for the CFSP instead of and in place of a Council presidency that is forced to concentrate on its conciliation duties
This effectively implies a new division of tasks that is likely to give fresh impetus to the Union
In this connection I fully approve of the idea that qualified majority voting should become the general procedure for decision-making in the Council
Unanimous voting would then become the exception its use only justified on the grounds of the seriousness and importance of a few rare decisions
What is more I think that any future change to the weighting of votes needs to retain the present principle of the relative over-representation of Member States with small and medium-sized populations
To conclude I should like to highlight the quality and importance of the work carried out by the rapporteur in the hope of helping European institutions to cope with the challenges they have yet to meet and overcome
There are several comments I should like to make in relation to this excellent report
I do not believe that Parliament should get involved in the Council internal procedures as the Council has nothing to do with ParliamentsContrary to the rapporteur wishes as set out in paragraph I believe that we would be ill-advised to make a distinction between the national and legislative role of ministers as this might lead to calls for the creation of a new institution such as a senate which we do not needI do not approve of the high-profile role the rapporteur confers on the European Council as it is a role that appears to result from a very centralised and radical approach to politicsI do not share the rapporteur scepticism concerning the rotating presidency
I cannot accept his proposal to hand over the tasks of Union leadership to the President of the Commission
On the contrary I think that the presidency with its enhanced responsibilities has a significant effect on the attitude of each Member State towards the process of integrationThis report once again raises the problem of small and large European countries in the context of the weighting of votes in the CouncilI was extremely pleased to note the reasonable and well-thought out approach taken by the rapporteur on this issue and his rejection of the popularity-seeking attitude shown by the larger Member States
It is an attitude that comes from an unfounded fear of being dwarfed by a coalition of less populated states
What we need to do is to find a way of preventing a deadlock in the key areas of common legislation and extending the use of qualified majority voting
However we must not lose sight of the fundamental principle of the partnership between small medium and large states formed on the basis of mutual confidence and equality it is a principle that is all too often forgotten today
Lastly I would wonder about the status of this text
If it intends to establish Parliament position for subsequent negotiations it is somewhat premature but if it aims to launch the debate it is welcome
For once I shall abstain from voting
I do not oppose the report because it is both detailed and interesting
However if I voted in favour of it I would feel that I was making a definitive decision about a matter that has yet to be debated and that will surely evolve
I am disturbed that three quarters of this House should be backing a report which unequivocally advocates such a radical institutional overhaul of the EU without there having been any proper airing of the issues in the Member States or among ordinary citizens
The call for effective abolition of the right of veto and the desire to turn the Commission into a quasi-government constitute a huge leap in the direction of political federation and away from the principle of intergovernmental cooperation as enshrined in the Treaties
I wish to distance myself resolutely from this new trend
The Commission and in particular its president would gain power too It would be entrusted with tasks of leadership of the Union and would act as the driving force behind foreign and security policy in conjunction with the CFSP High Representative
This scenario is quite unacceptable to a non-aligned country
The Committee on Institutional Affairs is calling for qualified majority voting in the Council to become the general rule even when contributions to the EU budget are at stake
I therefore voted against the report
I believe that the EU should be based on intergovernmental cooperation
I cannot therefore endorse statements lamenting that there must still be unanimity when decisions are taken in certain fields
Nor can I go along with the idea that the Commission should be the only body enjoying the right of initiative
Not allowing elected representatives to amend or propose legislation constitutes a serious breach of democratic principles
Finally I believe that the CFSP High Representative should be Council-based and not transferred to the Commission as the rapporteur proposes
The European Parliamentary Labour Party welcomes much of the Bourlanges report which deals with an important subject and makes many useful suggestions
Nevertheless the EPLP has serious reservations about some aspects of the report
We voted against paragraph which suggests that the leadership of the EU and the conduct of foreign policy will have to be handed over to the Commission President and the High Representatives of the CFSP while the Council presidency concentrates on its conciliation tasks
If senior appointments are to retain the confidence of all Member States they should be appointed by consensus
We therefore voted against paragraph 
We do not accept proposals to extend QMV to matters of taxation own resources foreign policy and the UK rebate
We therefore voted against paragraphs and 
The EPLP position was to abstain on the final report
Gutiérrez Díaz report A
We fully endorse the assessment of the Treaty of Amsterdam offered by the rapporteur in paragraph where he says that the new provisions in many ways constitute a new stage in the development of the European Union
In this connection we welcome his reference to the principle of non-discrimination
It is absolutely vital in our view that the Treaty be ratified as soon as possible
We cannot therefore support paragraph 
On paragraph we feel that it would be inappropriate in the current circumstances for the European Parliament to propose that police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters be defined more broadly
As a result we are unable to accept paragraph 
The Gutiérrez Díaz report unintentionally shows right from its title the impasse the European Union is about to reach stating that it is aimed at strengthening Union institutions with a view to establishing an area of democracy
What more blatant admission could there be that for federalists European democracy is now an objective rather than a path to achieving a goal
This is indeed the situation we are faced with because of the adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty which is building a European superstate at the cost of a real decline in democracy
On the one hand it is destroying the national democratic area excluding national parliaments and making national law including constitutional law subordinate to Community law
On the other hand it is proving incapable for the time being of establishing the slightest democracy at European level quite simply because the European people do not exist
What is more the transposition of parliamentary procedures into this House only manages to produce joint positions that are all too often artificial and that are only ever accorded secondary importance by the people of Europe
It would appear that in spite of all of these diversions genuine democracy remains the ultimate goal
I however have my doubts about this
Once antidemocratic institutions that are allowed to be strengthened without impunity are established a return to control by the citizens can no longer take place spontaneously and painlessly
In spite of its good intentions the Gutiérrez Díaz report exacerbates the situation by proposing that all the rights conferred on citizens by membership of the European Union be brought within the ambit of a specific Treaty title on citizens rights
It is to be noted that this aim appears very similar to that of the German Presidency which has proposed to create a charter of fundamental rights for the post-Amsterdam period
However this is a guideline that would bypass national democracies even further and restrict their legitimate role as a pillar of the Union
It is indeed this role that we wish to preserve instead so that democracy and respect for the people are always present in the life of the Community
European integration will only progress in the long term if the citizens of the Member States see any interest in it either for themselves or their children
Therefore it is in fact vital that the Union citizens do not perceive the various stages in European integration simply as an accumulation of ethereal texts but as something tangible and meaningful for all
The rapporteur is right to lay particular emphasis on the practical provisions that have resulted from the adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty
So surely the free movement of people is thus a tangible way for everyone to assess the reality of the Union in a positive manner
On the contrary the insecurity associated with organised crime which to a certain extent is also a result of the removal of internal borders generates a very negative image of European integration in the eyes of our citizens
In my opinion it would be irresponsible of us to lead citizens to believe that it is possible to simply remove internal borders in Europe without there being any negative effects something that the rapporteur does not do
The free movement of persons naturally goes hand in hand with the creation of an area of security and justice which also enjoys enhanced police and judicial cooperation and respect for transparency and legal certainty
It therefore falls to the various institutions to act promptly each in the area of its responsibilities in order to meet people expectations
I am absolutely convinced that it would be beneficial for everyone if the Council and the Commission were more open in their cooperation with the European Parliament in these areas as in many others
And on this particular point I fully agree with the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs
This resolution which was unfortunately adopted includes a series of demands amongst which are increased power for the Court of Justice the coordination of national employment policies at EU level the creation of legal bases for the formulation of social legislation legal recognition for transnational or European political parties with an entitlement to financial resources from the Union budget
These are all important issues but they must be the subject of wide-ranging debate in the Member States before politicians from this Parliament adopt a position
And this debate which will need to be held at all levels in all contexts and in all countries will have to centre on the major questions
Where is the EU going What are the goals being pursued by the various organisations
What do our citizens want
If we wish to retain people faith in us I believe that the time has come to discuss these matters openly
I cannot support this report in its entirety
I believe instead that
Since the EU ought to be based on intergovernmental cooperation the employment policies of the Member States should not be coordinated at Community level although far-reaching cooperation is of course possible
This applies to legislation on pensions civil legislation etc-Unanimity should be required in the Council on matters of asylum visas immigration and free movement-Schengen should be done away with as soon as possible-Police cooperation should also cease we already have Interpol and it works very well indeed
The European Parliamentary Labour Party voted for the Gutiérrez Díaz report but with reservations
We abstained on paragraph which is critical of the use of unanimity in the Third Pillar and paragraph which calls for co-decision for Third Pillar decisions
We abstained on paragraphs and on the Court of Justice and voted against paragraph calling for the incorporation of Schengen into the Treaty and paragraph which criticises the Danish Irish and UK opt-out
The Amsterdam Treaty has not even come into force and would be better judged after it has been tested in practice
Paragraph calls for funding for transnational political parties
We oppose this
Bowe report A
Mr President GMOs provide an extra tool of dependency for nations and people as is already the case for non-reproducible hybrid seeds and generally speaking all patented life forms because these days man madness is leading him to patent the living world
Let us not be mistaken all of this comes under a strategy for world domination since people are being deprived of the ability to feed themselves
We must not forget in passing that these methods lead to large-scale job losses and destroy the environment quality tastes and biodiversity
As the next millennium approaches here is a sample menu the European Commission might serve up human gene ham hormone-enriched beefburgers somatotrophic pasteurised cheese and genetically modified apples from Chile
Ladies and gentlemen I wish you all bon appétit 
Mr President I voted against this because despite two major successes namely the ban on marketing those genes that can be made untraceable and the fact that we managed to insist on a certificate of liability insurance the text on which the House decided at the end of the day is worse than bad
It represents the demolition of environmental and safety standards
We have even backtracked from the Commission stance
The fact that we want to limit the marketing of products to a fixed period where there is inadequate monitoring experience relating to the marketing of comparable organisms effectively means that human beings and their environment are being used as guinea pigs because if there is not enough experience available these products should not be put on the market at all
And we have no right to say that they can be marketed for a fixed period
This is tantamount to saying that we shall see what has happened after twelve years and only then will we draw the necessary conclusions
That I believe is utterly irresponsible just like the simplified procedure the procedure for simultaneous release in several Member States and the Category I classification because all these organisms fall under Category I This means in effect that an environmental risk assessment is virtually ruled out
I find this more than deplorable along with the fact that no scope has been created for more stringent labelling
This makes it obvious that we have bowed the knee to industrial interests here
We shall see what the Council makes of it and whether we can still pull the fat out of the fire together and initiate something that will really take us forward
I also hope that industry will finally get down to discussing the risks and that the insurance business stands by what it has said namely that the risk is too great for it to cover
I call on all Irish MEPs to protect the Irish environment and peoples health by voting to strengthen the Directive on the Release of Genetically Engineered Organisms in the Environment
This is a huge opportunity to safeguard the future of Ireland clean green image of food production
I am calling on the Irish representatives to come off the fence and along with other Members of the Parliament to resist the intimidating lobbying tactics of the gene-industry
These companies are panicking because their plan to foist their tampered food products on the public in secret has been exposed
Governments and even the companies themselves are now admitting the dangers of gene crops and food so the genetic industry is now reverting to type by pressurising governments on the quiet while trying to fool consumers in public
The Bowe report will subsequently translate into the legislation to govern the crops grown and the food eaten throughout Europe
The Green Group is pushing for full and open labelling of GE foods proper risk assessment and a moratorium on GE crop and food which would be of immense benefit to Irish agriculture
I call on all Irish MEPs to support socio-economic provisions along with public liability
One of the most important questions is that of liability and who pays if there is a crisis like BSE
The insurance companies say that they cannot give cover unless the risks can be quantified
I am demanding that the Irish Government take steps to ensure the biotech companies quantify the risks to consumers
As well as resisting the attempts by the multinationals to water down these proposals we have to eliminate fast-tracking mechanisms which would allow the gene industry to be unaccountable and uncontrollable
Genetically modified organisms particularly when used in food crops have been the topic of intense debate within the Union
Ethical considerations underlie many of the questions surrounding genetic engineering technology
Research has run on ahead with public debate and political regulation lagging well behind
Ordinary citizens lack the knowledge to oversee developments and this limits all our scope for reflection and critical appraisal
This directive is designed to introduce strict rules to govern the deliberate release of GMOs The safety of human beings and the environment is put first which is a good thing
And many of the amendments tighten up the Commission text
Nonetheless we feel that a more restrictive stance on the development of GMOs for use in food production should have been adopted from the outset Equally there should have been broader discussion of the advantages of this kind of research before we accepted trial applications followed by the presence of GMOs in our food
We also believe that consumers have an absolute right to information which means that they ought to be able to choose whether to buy products containing genetically modified ingredients or substances
The title of the Commission new proposal for a directive regarding the placing of GMOs on the market might mislead people as to its severity directive relating to the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms
And yet in spite of this somewhat dramatic title the actual context of the text turns out to be quite vague to the extent that Members including those from the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations out of saw fit to oppose it
The content of this text is admittedly not completely negative
For example the European Parliament has just voted in favour of some interesting amendments that recognise civil liability and force people to take out sufficient liability insurance to cover the losses that might be incurred by persons releasing GMOs
In spite of this positive point there are four major faults with the report which have led us to reject it
First it confirms that a centralised procedure in Brussels for the release of GMOs is planned for the majority of cases without any safeguard for Member States who would like to adopt more stringent measures
Therefore under the auspices of the single market it appears that underhand plans are afoot which might soon force Member States who do not want anything to do with GMOs to soften their approach towards them against their wishes
Second it creates a simplified consent procedure for GMOs which contains a number of references
Speeding up the procedure of common law like this would mean that cases would not be properly researched and that is unacceptable
Third the European Parliament has extended the time-limit for placing GMOs on the market to years whereas the Commission itself only proposed a seven-year time-limit
This undoubtedly signifies a victory for pressure groups who have been lobbying the larger parties in this House both the Socialists and the Christian Democrats
Fourth some high risk GMOs have not been banned with sufficient force
Like the Green Group we would like to see three categories of GMOs prevented from being placed on the market GMOs with antibiotic resistant genes GMOs with toxins that are dangerous for useful fauna and GMOs likely to crossbreed with similar wild or cultivated species
Instead of voting for an outright ban Parliament has voted in favour of some very weak amendments while claiming that certain measures need to be taken to prevent the transfer of genes from these GMOs
Overall this proposal for a directive provides a general view of the direction in which European integration is currently heading it is taking power away from the Member States and centralising it in Brussels under the pretext of being able to defend the people better
However once the people have been stripped of their powers the central decision-makers who are in the driving seat are themselves not monitored by anyone and do what they like
In the end we find ourselves in a no-win situation at the mercy of forces that are based in Brussels far more than anywhere else
Questions concerning genetically modified products loom larger every day
Neither politicians nor scientists can foresee the consequences for man and nature
It is therefore unforgivable as things stand to be giving the green light to genetically modified products future generations may well have to pay dearly for our mistakes
The Environment Committee has produced a good piece of work endeavouring to make the best of the situation
Many of the amendments were tabled in a similar spirit
Sadly Parliament did not vote in favour of some of the most important ones however including the right of Member States to say no a black list and more stringent labelling requirements
Along with the rest of the Green Group I therefore voted against the report
Future employment in Europe largely depends on the successful development of biotechnology
This is why it is important that European firms and research institutes should be able to operate in the same way as their partners in America and Japan
Only then will they be able to survive against cut-throat competition worldwide
The industry needs a clear and viable legislative framework and it goes without saying that great care is needed in this new field
Many of today amendments to the Commission proposal for the release of genetically engineered organisms in the environment would result in excessively restrictive legislation for the biotechnology sector putting the food industry and the EU competitive position at a disadvantage compared with the US
The legislation would also have an impact in the Netherlands where biotechnology has become one of the country leading sectors and this is why the VVD delegation has departed from the ELDR Group position by voting against a number of amendments including those tabled by Mrs Dybkjaer and Mr Eisma
The VVD continues to demand an unambiguous viable and straightforward European legislative framework with simplified procedures for the biotechnology sector
The position of our group regarding the Commission communication on biotechnology favours some degree of development in this sunrise industry while taking great care to anticipate potential drifts
With this in mind strict labelling procedures must be introduced to enable genetically engineered products to be monitored effectively
During the various debates we have had on genetically modified organisms industrialists have persistently stated that the release of such organisms is under control
This is why our group supported the urgent request calling on the Commission to introduce specific rules relating to the liability of the various operators
The BSE crisis has highlighted the dangers of focusing all research on extremely high levels of agricultural production and the need to provide for a genuinely independent monitoring system
To this end we supported the plan to create a central scientific committee but we must ensure that the proper procedures are developed so that the mistakes that were made during the mad cow crisis are not repeated
To conclude our group places much emphasis on the need to retain the precautionary principle so as to guarantee both consumer and environmental protection
The citizens of Europe will only fully accept biotechnology if they receive genuine assurances about its safety
It takes years for experiments to be carried out on medicines before they can be placed on the market
However here we are faced with the prospect of GMOs being released into the environment after only three years of piecemeal experiments and with no extra time allotted for assessing their direct or indirect effects on the environment and health
In this regard we must bear in mind the answer given by the Commissioner for Industrial Affairs when asked if he thought that industrialists and politicians were not playing the sorcerer apprentice once again
Mr Bangemann replied We must not create metaphysical problems with GMOs placing them on the market will prove their worth
In other words in the Commission view the best guinea pigs are still the consumers to the extent that they are not even granted the right to correct information on the goods they are buying as labelling procedures are so lax
They are not even granted the freedom of choice
The report mentions on page that genetically modified crops present few risks but what does this decidedly unscientific term actually mean
We should remember that the nuclear power station at Chernobyl was until April said to have presented few risks
According to Professor Cabrol we should not ban GMO production in Europe and thus let the Americans have a monopoly on GMO products
This is an interesting comment but his conclusions are surprising since if the Americans are allowed to export products that have not been fully tested to Europe the best response is not for us to produce similar products ourselves
The only acceptable answer for the sake of public health is to ban the import of such products altogether
This is the logical application of a simple but fundamental principle namely the precautionary principle
How can we explain the European Commission submission in the face of American agri-industrial lobbies
GMOs sterile hybrid seeds the patenting of life forms and so on are all perhaps part of a more global strategy concerning people and nations dependency on food
As one American secretary of state said food is the best weapon of the future
Mr President while I support technological progress I am voting in favour of this report today because I believe that my constituents should be protected from the excesses of US biotechnology firms like Monsanto eager only to turn a quick profit
All genetically modified foods must be clearly labelled to allow consumers make an informed choice when feeding their families and loved ones
Recent advances in bio-technology were first brought home to us by British scientists when they produced Dolly the Sheep the world first genetically-cloned sheep
And with proper safeguards biotechnology has the potential to help mankind defeat world hunger and disease
Without proper safeguards however the consequences of altering the order of nature are unthinkable
Safety must always come first
The Labour Government has proven its commitment to the welfare of consumers by creating the FSA Food Standards Agency
Its Tory predecessors in contrast were committed only to the welfare of the food industry and created BSE
Only Labour will stand up for ordinary people against Monsanto madness and ensure that the food on our plates is safe to eat
The sitting was suspended at pm and resumed at pm
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions
B by Mrs André-Léonard on behalf of the ELDR Group on presidential elections in KazakhstanB by Mrs Lalumière on behalf of the ARE Group on presidential elections in KazakhstanB by Mrs Schroedter and Mr Lagendijk on behalf of the V Group on violation of international human rights standards in KazakhstanB by Mr Swoboda and Mrs Hoff on behalf of the PSE Group on the presidential elections in KazakhstanB by Mrs Castellina and Mrs Sornosa Martínez on behalf of the GUENGL Group on presidential elections in KazakhstanB by Mr von Habsburg on behalf of the PPE Group on presidential elections in the Republic of Kazakhstan
Madam President the presidential elections in Kazakhstan on January were a slap in the face for the partnership and cooperation agreement that the Union signed with that country
Democracy and human rights are now a fundamental element of these agreements but the conditions under which the elections were held did not correspond to the promises which the Kazakh Government made
The OSCE rightly refused to give the elections a seal of legitimacy and the Union too must also and not for the first time clearly link the continuation of cooperation with progress in democratisation
President Nazarbayev must move quickly to take corrective measures and we must hope that he has the means to do so
The suspension of cooperation must be a real option if he cannot guarantee that the forthcoming elections will be truly democratic
I know that this is easy to say here in the House but if we do not take this approach with a country like this with which we have signed agreements then we are in nowhere country
In the meantime we must step up cooperation with social organisations and the free press to promote democracy in Kazakhstan
As I have said this is not a task we are setting ourselves it is a request we are making to the Kazakh Government
Madam President it is essential that we work for consolidation of the democratisation process in Kazakhstan ensuring that developments take place in the interest of human rights and fundamental freedoms The partnership agreement signed with the EU stipulates that Kazakhstan must comply with OSCE rules for free and fair elections
The serious crimes committed in connection with the presidential elections in January deserve firm condemnation
We do not wish to see a repeat performance with infringements of civil liberties when elections are held later this year
Freedom of the press and the right of individuals to stand as candidates are fundamental elements of democratic elections
I would like to use this opportunity to ask the Commission what steps it intends to take in order to ensure that the existing partnership and cooperation agreement with Kazakhstan is fully implemented And how does the Commission plan to assist in strengthening the faltering democratisation process there
We must help to ensure that democracy fares better than it did at the ill-fated presidential elections in January
Madam President on behalf of my Group I wish to say how profoundly disappointed we were in the conduct of the recent presidential elections in Kazakhstan
It is clear that these elections did not conform to OSCE standards for free and fair elections which are part of the commitments entered into with the signing of the partnership and cooperation agreement between the EU and Kazakhstan
This House should make it absolutely clear to President Nazarbayev as both Mr Bertens and Mr Holm have said that implementation of the PCA will depend on progress with the democratisation process and full respect for human rights especially in the forthcoming local and parliamentary elections
At the same time the Commission must monitor the human rights situation in Kazakhstan closely and report back to this House on progress or the lack of it
Kazakhstan is a vast country with great economic and political potential
It should not allow that potential to be stymied by its failure to guarantee civil and human rights
Madam President I believe that when we talk about Kazakhstan we often tend to wag the finger at the Kazakhs and tell them that they ought to start functioning as a perfect democracy with immediate effect
In so doing we forget that Kazakhstan has only been a free country for ten years and it has actually done remarkably well to come as far as it has done in that time not to mention the fact that Kazakhstan is a very important partner for us in that region a partner which I am glad to say has freed itself of at least some of the shackles of Russian rule
We should show a great deal more understanding towards the Kazakhs as well as remembering that we did not become perfect democracies overnight we too required a lengthy development process
So we should exercise the same patience with the Kazakhs that we keep demanding for ourselves
The only reason why I wanted to say that is that I believe we ought not to forget in our dialogue with Kazakhstan how important this country is not only for our own future but also for that of the entire region
We should therefore take due account of this important role and show patience of course we should keep telling them how to improve but without that unbearably schoolmasterly tone which we are all too often inclined to adopt
After all we must not forget that the Kazakhs are a people with a great history of which they have reason to be proud if we act like the world teacher they will react in a way that neither benefits us nor promotes the achievement of our objective
Madam President ladies and gentlemen as chairman of Parliament delegation for relations with Kazakhstan and other countries in Central Asia I closely followed the news we received about the progress of the presidential elections held in Kazakhstan on January
Unfortunately this news was not as encouraging as we had hoped as regards the observance of essential and indispensable democratic standards
Kazakhstan is an important country surrounded by other important countries Uzbekistan Turkmenistan Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan and even Mongolia all of which are of enormous interest to the European Union
This is due not only to their significant potential in terms of natural resources natural gas oil gold wool but because the European Union is the global power that at this moment in time can contribute most to resolving the deficits that oppress these countries most after almost a century of Soviet influence the democratic deficit the human rights deficit and the deficit in terms of learning how to establish themselves in a free market economy
That is why this resolution comes at just the right time All it does is to draw attention to the democratic safeguard clause in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Kazakhstan
It is also timely in that free elections are going to be held in Kazakhstan this year
However ladies and gentlemen I agree with Mr von Habsburg
I would like to end by warning you that this resolution must be seen more as a statement of help and understanding than as a reproach
We cannot expect to see perfect results immediately
What we really want is for the process of democratisation to continue
We want it to progress as quickly as possible to continue and to be free of obstacles
Madam President ladies and gentlemen I agree with the points that have been made about the need to see Kazakhstan in a historical perspective and about the importance of Kazakhstan to us and in the region and also about the fact that we have to encourage Kazakhstan to move further to say when things have gone wrong but to do it in the right way
The resolutions are based in part on the statement made on January by the presidency on behalf of the European Union
It was clear ahead of the presidential elections that the way in which they were to be conducted fell short of OSCE standards and that is why the OSCE did not send a full monitoring mission nor did the EU participate
I also agree with the preliminary statement issued by the OSCE Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights that we have a basis for important further cooperation with Kazakhstan in these fields
President Nazarbayev announced last October a wide-ranging programme aimed at the gradual democratisation of Kazakh society
The Kazakh Government has assured us that it intends to cooperate with the OSCE and the EU in implementing this programme in particular regarding the law on parliamentary elections which will be held in the course of this year
I expect the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Kazakhstan to enter into force in the coming months
The first cooperation Council has already been scheduled for July and it is the Council intention to continue the exchanges of view on the democratisation process and to incorporate these into the political dialogue foreseen in the PCA
The European Parliament will also open a direct dialogue on these issues with members of the Kazakh parliament through the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee which is one of the three institutions which will oversee the PCA
Despite the flaws and irregularities which marred the presidential elections the atmosphere in Kazakhstan remains relatively liberal
These elections were the first in the history of the country to be contested by a number of candidates
I am firmly of the view that the only way to improve the situation is through constant patient work on the part of the EU and other donors and international organisations
The PCA offers us the basis for this
Moreover we are about to launch a major TACIS project to support the entry into force of the PCA and you will recall that the PCA incorporates by reference the principles set out in the OSCE documents
Commissioner van den Broek intends to visit Kazakhstan shortly and we will reiterate our determination to implement the principles we have jointly subscribed to and our readiness to assist with the further development of democratic institutions and the rule of law
The Commission will keep Parliament informed of developments in Kazakhstan and other countries of the region with regard to the implementation of our agreements
Thank you Commissioner

The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions
B by Mr Fassa and Mr Bertens on behalf of the ELDR Group on the war between Ethiopia and EritreaB by Mr Telkämper Mrs Aelvoet Mr Schörling and Mr Tamino on behalf of the V Group on the new outbreak of hostilities between Ethiopia and EritreaB by Mr Vecchi on behalf of the PSE Group on the conflict between Ethiopia and EritreaB by Mr Hory Mr Castagnède and Mr Scarbonchi on behalf of the ARE Group on the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea
Madam President after the cease-fire the senseless war between Ethiopia and Eritrea has broken out once again
I really wonder whether we will ever manage to make the two sides realise that there can only be losers here
The issue now is who actually started the fighting a fratricidal struggle between two obstinate leaders who six years ago lived in one country
Both sides claim land on the basis of old colonial maps and both are too stubborn even to talk to the peace negotiators and listen to what they have to say
There are mutual recriminations with each accusing the other of having started the trouble
All the efforts of the UN IGAD and the OAU have come to nothing but I hope that they will not give up
International pressure must be brought to bear on both sides to bring about a new cease-fire for a start
Eritrea and Ethiopia must realise that they have a great deal to lose if Lomé cooperation is suspended
Both sides will eventually come back to the peace proposals put forward by the OAU or at least I hope they will
I also hope that they will come to their senses quickly
The longer it takes them to realise that there can be no military solution to this conflict the more enormous will be the cost
The disastrous effect that this is having on the people and the economy of both countries is indescribable
I can tell you this from first hand experience as I spent some time there when both countries were still united
I have to say that the situation in this area of Africa deserves to be given our fullest attention
Madam President may I make an initial remark outside my allotted speaking time
At our last part-session we said that the presidency of the Council should attend these debates
It would be good if that were the case but unfortunately I see nobody from the presidency
Perhaps you could arrange that for next time through the Bureau
On the border between Ethiopa and Eritrea serious conflicts occurred between those two countries in May and June of last year
There were battles in which thousands died in June a moratorium was signed but hostilities have broken out again
We have a frontier conflict here which the population certainly does not want
International conciliation efforts appear to have failed
Nevertheless we should not stop trying to achieve peace in that region because peace will never be achieved there by military means
It is right to say that we shall have to exert pressure on both countries
That is why it is also right to threaten them with suspension of support under the Lomé Convention and of development aid from the European Union and its Member States
But this pressure may not be enough
Perhaps it would also be important and appropriate and we saw this when we met the two ambassadors in the Committee on Development and Cooperation and in the Executive of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly for us to draw up a development plan subject to both sides withdrawing their military hardware to their showing willingness to negotiate and to their being prepared to develop democracy and the rule of law and to grant reciprocal inspection rights
We would then deliver a development plan and would step up the current level of development aid as an initial measure
It was widely predicted Armed conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea has broken out again with unprecedented violence
Although the information reaching us is very patchy it is clear that there have already been thousands of victims military and civilian and the conflict which apparently flared up after a small border problem is threatening to become one of the bloodiest wars in the history of Africa
In this Parliament we have always been concerned about relations and tensions between Ethiopia and Eritrea and Parliament Committee on Development and Cooperation succeeded in getting the ambassadors from both countries to attend several meetings it organised something which no-one else has managed to do
Today we call on the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea to cease hostilities immediately
We also call for absolute compliance with the moratorium on air raids which has already been violated unfortunately
The leaders of the two countries of the Horn of Africa now have the historic responsibility of choosing between peace and even worse crimes against their peoples
The OAU proposal for an agreement between the two countries must be accepted by both parties without further delay before the situation on the ground renders it obsolete
All arms supplies and military assistance to the two warring sides must immediately cease as called for yesterday by the United Nations Security Council
The European Union must join the Organisation for African Unity in applying intense pressure and offering political and diplomatic mediation which has been totally inadequate in the last few months
The United States of America might have been expected to take on the task over the last few months but it has proved quite incapable of doing so
So we call on the Council to take a clear and strong political initiative along these lines and on the Commission to ensure that the thousands of refugees and victims of the conflict receive the maximum humanitarian assistance wherever possible
Madam President alas the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea has a long history but so have human rights abuses in Ethiopia as all of us know only too well
One can but continue to deplore the fact that international mediation efforts have failed to secure a peaceful settlement and the two countries must surely share the blame
The double tragedy is that the population of the two countries is poverty-stricken and suffering in so many ways
This makes it all the more difficult to link development aid and Lomé-related benefits
But it may be that a hard line will need to be taken by the EU
Clearly the OAU and the UN have a continuing role to play but is it out of the question for the ACP-EU Joint Assembly to play a key role as well in trying to resolve this desperate situation
Madam President in yesterday International Herald Tribune the following appeared in the section News from years ago
I will quote it in English and hope that the interpreters can follow me Eritrea fate
Rome
Foreign Minister Sforza said that the interests of three powers Great Britain Italy and Ethiopia are involved in the problem of Eritrea former Italian African colony
Count Sforza expressed the hope that Eritrea would not be annexed to Ethiopia
The attempt to reconcile these interests at the expense of Eritrea by territorial partition recalls the old scramble for Africa
Count Sforza said it was repugnant
He said Eritrea could achieve independence after a period of trusteeship administration
End of quotation
Fifty years later on February the headline in the International Herald Tribune reads Addis Ababa rules out cease-fire in border war
So that is that
The article goes on to say that Washington is particularly angry that Antonovs and Migs are being used to bombard Eritrean territory
This is exactly what Ethiopia has been doing for some time arrogantly disregarding all advice or agreements simply because it enjoys political support in the world
However I think that we cannot allow this to continue we need to adopt a rather more critical approach
Ethiopia diplomatic circles may be bombarding us with paper to try to convince us that its cause is just as it has every right to do but at the same time various issues relating to the border war and attacks on the Oromos the largest minority in the area some of whom have been imprisoned are being brushed under the carpet
Our urgent resolution today is a desperate attempt by the European Parliament to prevent the war in the Horn of Africa from escalating and further destabilising the region and it even calls for more humanitarian aid
Quite honestly I think that we should be talking about stopping financial aid since it is obviously being used to buy Antonovs and Migs
We all know that Russia will not supply on credit because it needs cash in hand
If it appears that Eritrea too is not prepared to listen to what we say then it should suffer the same fate
Although the tone of our resolution is very mild and no mention is actually made of stopping financial aid I would like to ask Commissioner Brittan what he thinks about this because it is just a waste of money like in Angola
Madam President after the madness of the red dictator Menghistu and the tribal hatreds of the Yemen the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea places the Horn of Africa centre stage again while Europe looks on with nothing but words to offer
Antagonism which could have been resolved through democratic dialogue has instead deteriorated into a tragic situation inflamed by ethnic claims
The Africans therefore need to consolidate still delicate regional balances by combining as much of their authority as possible and in particular by involving civil society so as to put the necessary pressure on the governments involved to find a peaceful solution to the conflict
This is where Europe should intervene speaking one language the language of development aid guided and determined by the drive to achieve political and social stability which remains the only means of preventing conflicts and reducing the number of zones at risk
Madam President in the resolution we are discussing today great importance attaches to paragraph which actually says everything
That is where we say precisely what is to be done namely that the payments made by the European Union to Ethiopia and Eritrea should be linked to both countries compliance with certain conditions
I believe that this is enormously important if we bear in mind on the one hand that the war which we now experiencing between Ethiopia and Eritrea was entirely foreseeable and on the other hand that the settlement of this conflict will surely be frustrated by a real lack of democracy in both countries
To my mind it is a very serious problem when I see for instance that newspapers in Ethiopia which are naturally controlled by the government are even now reporting continuously on the amounts of money they have already amassed for the next election campaign
I have to say quite honestly that I fear the campaign chest contains some money which our taxpayers might have provided whereas the opposition has to try desperately to raise funds abroad in order to conduct its election campaign in order to establish itself as a proper opposition and the resources for that are non-existent
This is extremely regrettable and I very much hope that the appropriate steps will be taken within the European Union to ensure that the funds we provide are used for legitimate purposes
I am sure the Commissioner will agree with that
We have to call on both sides to cease all hostilities and stop fighting because clearly negotiation is the only way to solve the problem
The Commission has underlined on several occasions to both governments the need to resolve and settle the conflict by peaceful means alone
A military option or so-called solution will entail and is already entailing enormous human suffering and loss
We will continue to support all efforts aimed at peaceful resolution of the conflict in particular the OAU efforts and proposals
We will continue to put the maximum pressure on both parties are willing to take any action needed to help find a solution and are currently examining what could be done
I listened with interest to Mr Moorhouse suggestion that the EUACP Joint Assembly could play a role and will draw that to the attention of my colleagues dealing on a more day-to-day basis with this issue
As regards the humanitarian situation the Commission is providing humanitarian assistance to both countries and has responded to appeals from both to assist the displaced population in the area of conflict
The Commission has allocated EUR to two NGOs Norwegian Church Aid and the Lutheran World Foundation for food and non-food assistance to persons affected by the conflict in Eritrea
In Ethiopia the Commission has allotted EUR through CISP an Italian NGO also for food and non-food assistance
Furthermore EUR was approved for ICRC activities in Ethiopia and in Eritrea
The Commission will continue to monitor closely the situation and is ready to mobilise additional resources if needed
I should like to comment on the wider point that has been raised
The Commission is preparing a communication to the Council on cooperation with ACP countries involved in armed conflicts
In the meantime in the absence of a European Union position on the matter the Commission does not think it should take unilateral and isolated measures in the case of this conflict
But the Commission has decided to allocate structural adjustment programme funds in smaller tranches and link further disbursements to a periodic review of the conflict and its possible impact on public spending particularly in the social sectors
Moreover when releasing financial assistance to countries in conflict the Commission will send a letter to the head of state or government requesting assurances that no funds are diverted for belligerent purposes
Thank you Commissioner

Madam President it is a sad fact that the European Parliament is once again having to draw attention to terrible events that are taking place in a so-called civilised country
I am referring here to the use of capital punishment in the United States of America
Despite the horror that we have expressed in a number of urgent resolutions a horror that we share with many human rights organisations all over the world with the churches and with Amnesty International the number of people being sentenced to death in the United States is increasing often because their trials are not conducted with due care
This afternoon we are calling for attention to be given to the case of forty-year-old Greg Summers who although innocent has been sitting for years on death row in the Alace Unit in Texas waiting for the lethal injection that is shortly to end his life
Our resolution calls on the judicial authorities at least to examine the application for a review of his case
We also call on the United States and in particular the authorities of the State of Texas to abolish the death penalty immediately and to sign up to a worldwide moratorium on the execution of death sentences
Finally there are a number of amendments calling for attention to be given to other similar cases and it goes without saying that we will vote for them
Madam President the European Parliament has always rejected the death penalty outright on humanitarian grounds
Once again circumstances compel us to appeal to the government of a civilised nation the United States of America not to carry out a death sentence
This time we are appealing on behalf of Greg Summers
He has always protested his innocence
There are doubts as to whether the trial was properly conducted
An appeal was lodged with the competent court in Texas and there has still been no response to it
For that reason our first request to the United States and the State of Texas is that this appeal should be considered Secondly we call on them to refrain in principle from carrying out death sentences commuting them instead to life imprisonment or other custodial sentences
Thirdly we call for them to join in a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty and we call on the institutions of the EU to pass this on to the relevant authorities
Let me turn to our group amendments on two cases involving Germans the brothers Karl and Walter LaGrand who have been sentenced to death in Arizona
This would be the first time since the Second World War that Germans were sentenced to death and executed
We call on the United States not to carry out their death sentences and we hope that these amendments will be incorporated into today resolution
In both cases we propose that the death sentences be commuted to life imprisonment or another appropriate custodial sentence
Leonard Peltier
Leonard Peltier has been sitting in gaol for years now and the American authorities have finally admitted that he was wrongly imprisoned
It is absolutely incredible and it is something the House should not just criticise but condemn
I hope that his case will be reviewed very quickly and it would appear appropriate that a pardon should be granted
Human rights must be defended all over the world it is as simple as that
Partly as a result of his treatment in prison Mr Peltier health has visibly declined but he is still being denied appropriate medical treatment for reasons which no one will explain
Like anyone else this man deserves proper medical treatment in hospital the prison hospital if necessary
A few months ago I put a number of questions to the Council here in the House about the Peltier case but the President-in-Office said that he did not think it necessary to take action and it was not in his power to do so
I would now urge the Commission to take the case up and I think that the Union as a whole should at least enter into discussions with the United States about its human rights policy
Madam President during December part-session the American delegation led by Angela Davis who had come to prevent Mumia Abu-Jamal from being executed alerted us to the fate of Leonard Peltier
I can still remember the alarming remarks made by their spokesperson Bobby Castillo who had experienced American prisons
As a leader of the American Indian Movement Leonard Peltier has played and continues to play a major role in the defence of the rights of indigenous people
Following the events of June in the Pine Ridge reserve South Dakota he was given two life sentences although no proof of his guilt was ever furnished and despite the fact that he had been illegally extradited from Canada
After years in prison his health has deteriorated dramatically and although he permanently suffers as a result of complications from an operation the prison management deny him access to adequate treatment in a specialised hospital
Amnesty International the IFHR and France Liberté have launched a new campaign to defend Leonard Peltier and fight the unacceptable number of human rights violations in the United States
Mumia Abu-Jamal who is still on death row has sent him a message of support
We should for our part once again participate in this action and ensure that public opinion is alerted throughout Europe
If Parliament adopts the resolution cosigned by my group it will be sending a clear message to the American authorities and prison directors
Leonard Peltier must be given the chance to get better and receive the appropriate medical treatment in the clinic of his choice
He must be released from prison so that he can take up his legitimate struggle for the defense of the rights of the indigenous people that the United States continues to scorn
Madam President I have always advocated the principle whereby the European Union must first of all put its own house in order before giving human rights lessons the world over
The latest report on human rights in the European Union shows that we are far from being beyond reproach in this area
In other words if I take the floor today to speak about the case of Leonard Peltier it is because all other possible avenues have genuinely been exhausted and time is short given the worrying state of Mr Peltier health
There are in fact two issues to our message to the United States
The first concerns the procedures used that resulted in Leonard Peltier sentence and the second concerns the prison authorities refusal to let him receive the appropriate medical treatment
We must remember that Amnesty International expressly admitted that it had reservations about the procedures that lead to Mr Peltier sentence and that the government authorities themselves admit to the vagueness that surrounded the sentence
Moreover the trial revealed the unusual methods used during the case preparation as my colleagues previously mentioned
These facts should have lead to a retrial but this case confirms that no court be it American or European will easily reopen a trial on which a sentence has already been passed
Herein lies a future struggle
However as the previous speaker pointed out the most incomprehensible and intolerable aspect of this case is the refusal of the American authorities to let Mr Peltier whose health has considerably deteriorated receive the medical attention he needs
The fact that prison facilities are unable to treat his condition is completely unacceptable as an argument to deny him the treatment he needs
Solutions do exist and have already been put forward
The refusal of the prison authorities to let him receive such treatment amounts to a blatant violation of human rights and of the commitments made by the United States
This is why our group will support the call for appropriate treatment and the request to grant Mr Peltier clemency
Madam President there is an annual pantomime that always sends something of a shiver down my spine or at least leaves me open-mouthed in amazement and that is the occasion when the President of the United States delivers his address on the state of the nation and the world
All the countries of the world are given plus and minus points
Words of praise and censure are pronounced
What it boils down to is that the whole world has to submit to American values and ideals
I believe it is very important to do what Parliament is doing today to hold a mirror in front of the Americans and to tell them that if they must try to force their values on everyone else they should also acknowledge that there are sections of the population of their own country some of them native Americans who may have other ideals in some respects a different bond with their own country with their own native soil than the Americans who arrived later
In this situation it is very useful for us to keep returning to the specific case of Leonard Peltier
This is a case that has attracted international attention
There is an international Peltier Committee of which I for example am a member and which has been dealing with the case for many years
I consider it particularly important that the European Parliament too has adopted a resolution calling for the case of Leonard Peltier to be placed on the agenda of the next talks between the delegation for relations with the United States and its American counterparts in order to expose something of the hypocrisy that has so often dominated the US line of argument in this matter
Peltier has now been kept in prison for years under exceedingly dubious circumstances
He is in very poor health
He has frequently been transferred which has happened whenever public pressure has mounted and has become too great a burden for the prison in which he was accommodated
This just goes to show that not only the US population but also the international community are really unwilling to accept such injustice from a country that is constantly preaching justice
Madam President it is with a feeling of dismay and deep anguish that we again raise our voices on behalf of Leonard Peltier languishing in an American jail for years for crimes he did not commit and after a court case which cast serious doubt on the administration of justice in the United States of America
Representative Joe Kennedy the son of the martyred President recently said This government has the moral duty to correct this injustice
Seeing that justice is upheld for Leonard Peltier would amount to a major act of reconciliation for past injustice done to the native American peoples
The anguish of millions of people who follow this case increases by the day with the rapid deterioration of his health
After an egregious case of medical malpractice in prison hospital Peltier is suffering a fibrosis of the masseter muscles and ankylosis of the mandibular joint
That means that he cannot eat that his mouth cannot be opened any more
The United States Bureau of Prisons still denies his request to be operated on by proper surgeons
Enough is enough
In the name of humanity we urge the United States Administration to take prompt care of its native son
We ask President Clinton to use his powers of pardon to release Leonard from prison immediately
Madam President half an hour ago in the discussion on Kazakhstan I said that we should not go around teaching the world how to behave
This time however it is quite a different matter because we are now dealing with those who constantly seek to lecture us as Mr Habsburg-Lothringen was saying before In other words we do have the right in this instance to say that things simply cannot go on like this
The whole process which I have studied very closely raises all sorts of doubts
Not a single piece of conclusive evidence was brought against Peltier
The way in which the American judiciary dispensed so-called justice in this case is simply indefensible for a highly civilised country
We should therefore point out to our American friends to whom of course we owe a huge debt of gratitude that something has to be done about Peltier
To deprive a person of years of his life to cast an Indian into prison and give him no opportunities to move about to give him literally not a single moment of freedom and to leave him languishing in uncertainty is utterly indefensible
Having followed the history of the Peltier case I would almost make so bold as to say that even if he had done something which I do not believe he would already have paid twice over for everything that happened
If we are convinced that he is innocent into the bargain that is all the more reason for us to make every effort to ensure that the Americans make justice prevail in their country too and if not justice then at least clemency
Madam President I would like to echo the sentiments of Mr von Habsburg
Truly this is a cross-party approach which we must take to the American authorities and insist that they respond to the many pleas which have been made for clemency on behalf of Leonard Peltier
It really is ironic that at a time when the future of the American President himself is being decided by Congress on an issue which bears very little similarity to the case against Leonard Peltier neither he nor in fact his predecessors have responded to the pleas of clemency made and awaiting a response for the last years
Therefore we in this Parliament should insist that when Mr Clinton resumes work presuming he is not impeached this is an issue which he should address as a matter of urgency
It is an issue which symbolises the treatment of American indigenous peoples a matter very dear to the heart of this Parliament and I hope that we adopt the resolution
Religious freedom
Madam President if the European Parliament resolves today to speak out against the increasingly frequent and violent infringements of religious freedom such a resolution will be a token of our great concern
Freedom of religious observance is a sign of respect not only for a very profound sense of devotion within many people but also for freedom of expression and association and hence for a significant part of the corpus of human rights
We are well aware that the violation of religious freedom can have many different causes
We also know that these waves of persecution are not always unleashed by governments
The causes vary from one country to another
There are power struggles for the control of sources of raw materials and water as in the Sudan where an armed majority is let loose on a large minority hatred envy and social and political tension can focus on ethnic groups as in India and Pakistan and now in Indonesia too
There are intolerant state religions as in Iran Afghanistan and other countries intolerance can also come from adherents of non-established religions
It would be impossible to list all the countries involved
The toleration of these persecutions and the forms they take cause us grave concern
They range from horrific murders as in the case of the Australian missionary Graham Staines and his two children in India to arrests torture and the disappearance of individuals they extend to trials on trumped-up charges
Extremism xenophobia and racism often rear their ugly heads with governments either impotent or unwilling to curb them
And yet there are many constitutions even in those very countries which enshrine freedom of religious worship and states have signed international covenants and UN conventions which are supposed to guarantee religious freedom
But there are also new religious laws with provisions that hover dangerously on the brink of intolerance and the European Parliament wishes to draw attention to these new risks
Religious groups themselves however must also remain tolerant towards those with different beliefs from their own and must respect freedom of conscience and of the individual as well as obeying the law of the land
That goes without saying
Abuse of religious freedom is symptomatic of the abuse of human rights That cannot be said often enough
Respect for the religious beliefs of minorities is also a sign of properly functioning constitutions rooted in natural law and guaranteeing tolerance and peaceful interaction between the various sections of the population
We in Europe have bitter historical experience of the effects of intolerance
We have overcome our intolerance and we are now trying in this House to help others to do the same
Political and social tensions have been used time and again in the past as an excuse for savage religious persecution
On the threshold of the third millennium and in view of the increasing degree of global interdependence I believe we must call on governments and on the representatives of the major religions who also exercise power in their own name to observe and to act upon the warning signs
By including democracy and human rights clauses in its treaties with non-Member States the European Union tries to ensure observance of human rights in the countries with which it cooperates
The European Parliament will not cease to ask searching questions on these matters
Suppression of religious freedom let me emphasise again is a clear symptom of human rights abuses the causes of which are rooted in national circumstances that need to be improved circumstances that not only result from religious strife but are also due in particular to social and political factors
The Commission supports interdenominational organisations in many countries in that way it reaches the people and gets to the roots of the problems and we want to ensure that the resources we provide for this purpose are not affected by the developments on which we have been focusing today and that these channels remain open to us
That is the background to the resolution which we have tabled today
Madam President years on from the introduction of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights more and more new rights are being added to it
In fact people have been saying quite rightly that it is all beginning to get out of hand
But this does not mean that the old established rights are now universally respected
Quite the reverse
There are still problems with the rights of religious minorities which we are discussing today in connection with an urgent resolution on the issue
In many countries people are still not free to express their religious beliefs in public or to follow their faith as they would wish
They are subject to persecution repression and discrimination
Recently in Parliament we have talked about Pakistan and Iran for example and now unfortunate events in India are giving us cause for concern
For years now but increasingly so in recent weeks Christians in India have suffered attacks by Hindu activists
In fact over the last year there has been an enormous increase in the number of attacks on Christian schools and churches in India Priests are accused of forcing people to convert to Christianity by bribing them with money and jobs for which they must be punished
Missionaries in particular are bearing the brunt of the attacks because they are seen as the legacy of British rule although strangely enough a lot of the missionaries are actually Christians of Indian origin a fact that seems to be overlooked here
Recently a large group of Christians and Muslims protested against the fact that the authorities are doing nothing to counter these forms of aggression
The attacks have been condemned in the media and it is certainly not true that the majority of the population approve of them
But this does not make the attacks any less worrying
One possible reason for them is the increase in the number of Christians in India and strangely enough they are the ones who have been bearing the brunt in recent times whereas before that it was mainly Muslims who were the target
The reason for this shift is clear the Muslims in India are concentrated in certain areas where they are an important factor when it comes to the elections
The Christian minority is smaller in number and is largely scattered all over the country so it is not important in electoral terms
Fortunately the Indian Government has now promised to set up a committee to investigate the recent attack on an Australian missionary and his children aged seven and ten
Yet it still appears indifferent to such occurrences
There is clearly a link between the increase in attacks in India and the fact that the BJP an extremist Hindu nationalist party has come to power
It believes that too much attention is paid to religious minorities in India and these attacks help it in its attempts to change this situation
With this resolution Parliament is making a clear appeal to countries and governments to take a responsible approach in dealing with religious minorities living in their territory
In particular it calls on the Indian Government to investigate the attacks of recent weeks and to try to prevent them in future
If the situation does not change the European Parliament and the Member States may wish to consider whether the events in India should affect their dealings with that country
Any respectable government must help to ensure that minorities in its country can live in freedom and can pursue their faith as they see fit
Human rights here involve not just rights for individuals but also an obligation upon governments to give minorities the freedom that is God gift to everyone
Madam President as someone who has a parent who was born in India and has many friends from India in the various and diverse communities of faith which make up India rich mosaic of cultures I can assure you that it gives me no pleasure to move this resolution today
There have been Christian communities in India since St Thomas landed in Kerala in AD 
By and large the Christians have lived alongside their neighbours for many years in peace
But the horrific death of Graham Staines and his two sons in January sadly brought to public attention a worsening persecution
These murders were the apex of a spiralling campaign of violence against Christians of all denominations
In a courageous address to his people the Prime Minister of India highlighted other incidents which are not acceptable in a modern tolerant democracy
These killings and other attacks have been unreservedly condemned by the World Hindu Council
The perpetrators of these atrocities do not represent the people of India or mainstream Hinduism
This resolution will be a significant message to those extremists that the people of Europe are in solidarity with all those who value and defend religious and communal tolerance
Finally not as a spokesman of my group but as an individual who worships Sunday-by-Sunday in a British church where we have members of the congregation who see India as their mother country let me assure the people of India that they are in our prayers and that we pray for both the persecuted and the persecutors
India you have our love our respect and our prayers in this difficult time
Madam President I oppose religious persecution wherever it occurs
However the text of this resolution I believe is ill-judged and unfair in singling out one country when throughout the region and elsewhere there are many similar cases
We should realise that Christianity has flourished in India for years longer in fact than here in Europe
I have been given permission to move on behalf of my group an oral amendment which is to add to rectial C the words and applauding the Prime Minister speech to the nation on January supporting this and opposing sectarian violence
We will be supporting that during the vote but unfortunately I will not be here because of the difficult timing of flights out of Strasbourg so I have to leave before the vote
The officials have a copy of that text and so will the Socialist Group representatives
Madam President the Liberal Group has always stood up for human rights in general and of course the right to freedom of religion deserves attention as part of this
I know that I am entering dangerous territory here but from time immemorial the greatest violations of human rights have been carried out in the name of religion
It has happened regularly throughout history that religious minorities have not been entitled to exercise the same rights as religious majorities and this is still true today with religious riots and other problems in India and on Ambon and structural repression in Iran and Afghanistan
We are not here just to protect Christians I hope we must protect and make room for all religions and this means standing up for Jehovah Witnesses in Russia for example who are currently facing prosecution in Moscow
The Liberal Group calls on the Commission and the Council to remain vigilant and to take account of religious freedom when assessing the human rights situation in third countries
I hope that there will be an opportunity in the next legislative period to produce a comprehensive report on human rights and the role of religion
Sadly I will not be here to see it
Mr Bertens I deliberately allowed you to exceed your time as you are one of the most regular attenders in this House
We have some time in hand but I would ask you not to exceed our time-limits
Mr President attacks and assaults on religious minorities are unfortunately frequent in India
Although the Indian Constitution expressly guarantees religious freedom the violence goes on Human rights are also constitutionally safeguarded
This resolution was tabled following the murder of a Christian missionary but we must not limit our attention to Christians alone other religious minorities in India such as Sikhs and Muslims are subjected to even greater religious persecution
There is no inevitability about these attacks people are not programmed to use violence
Not at all The truth is that several extremist groups are fanning the flames among them the VHP which patently has links running high up the political ladder
Nor should we forget the origins of the stand-off in India between different religious groupings social strife poverty and illiteracy
Efforts must be made to tackle these problems then we may well see less religious tension
India is not the only country where religious groups are pitted against one another however
Similar problems exist elsewhere in Asia for example in Pakistan Bangladesh and the Maldives
It is incumbent upon all of us to work for human rights
Religious freedom is one important element together with freedom of speech freedom of movement and the right to non-discrimination
We must also counter violent crimes against individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation
A great deal remains to be done in defence of these principles
Mr President I belong to a political party that has itself experienced in its own country what it is like when a government tries to clamp down on the freedom of expression of a growing opposition party so I have every sympathy for anyone whose freedom of expression or religion is under threat
We will therefore naturally be supporting the joint resolution on freedom of religion in India
We unreservedly condemn the use of violence against Indian Christians and we demand that the national government and the state authorities responsible for maintaining law and order should take firm measures where necessary not just against the perpetrators of the violence but also against the police officers who simply stand by and watch
I would point out here that in Orissa where a missionary and his two children were brutally murdered it is not the BJP that is in power contrary to what some people think but the Congress Party to which the likely murderer also belongs
The violence against Christians should also not make us forget that for the last ten years particularly in India thousands of Hindus have been systematically murdered by Muslim fanatics in riots and pogroms that have sadly been much worse than the current violence against Christians
For example in almost the entire Hindu population of the state of Kashmir around a quarter of a million people fled after a series of massacres in which more than a thousand people were killed
The instigator of this ethnic cleansing Amanula Khan the leader of the Kashmiri Muslims is still given a hero reception in various European countries including my own
I think a little consistency is called for here
In this respect the joint resolution which I think is very general could also have made reference to the systematic and particularly barbaric persecution of Christians and all non-Islamic religions in the neighbouring country of Pakistan
That omission has now been put right
For the rest we shall be happy to support this resolution
Mr President despite the important contribution made by representatives of all faiths to the humanitarian mission of aid care and relief for the underprivileged religious intransigence seems to be becoming increasingly radical in many parts of the world
Last month we heard that in clashes in Djakarta Islamic fundamentalist mobs were busy burning Catholic churches and hunting priests and nuns while the forces of public order looked on powerless
In India violence against the clergy is currently being encouraged by anti-Christian but also anti-Muslim and anti-Sikh rhetoric from fundamentalist groups who claim that they are determined to end any form of religious conversion in the country by the year 
This illustrates the lack of effective protection for religious minorities working in India but above all it shows that the real aim of racist fundamentalism is to restrict freedom of religion and opinion
All this should prompt Europe to stress its wholehearted support for the basic principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights making respect for those principles a prerequisite determining the very nature of the bilateral relations Member States maintain with countries which flagrantly disregard them
Mr President I shall begin with the resolutions on the death penalty
The Commission shares the general concern of the European Parliament on this issue especially in respect to the United States
We believe that in all cases in which the death penalty is imposed the guarantees laid down in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other international instruments should be respected
We welcome the adoption by the Council of Ministers of general guidelines on the issue of the death penalty in June 
These guidelines make it clear that the objective of the European Union is to work towards the universal abolition of the death penalty
We also welcome the adoption by the UN Human Rights Commission on April of a resolution which calls for countries that have not yet abolished the death penalty to apply a moratorium on the execution of death penalties with a view to abolition
EU Member States co-sponsored the resolution which had been introduced by Italy and it is striking to note that the United States voted against it
The Commission is greatly concerned about the rising number of executions taking place in the United States
The European Union has raised this question a number of times with the US authorities
As the Commissioner responsible for relations with the United States I have no embarrassment or hesitation in raising this issue with them it is appropriate that one should do so with a country with which we have close links and which has expressed on numerous occasions its concern about human rights elsewhere
The European Union follows closely individual cases in the United States and has made a number of démarches in specific instances
In the event that it concerns a person having the nationality of one of our Member States the Union will pay special attention to compliance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of which in Article provides arrested foreigners with the right to consular assistance
I turn to the specific case of Mr Peltier who of course is not on death row but is a long-term prisoner
I can only say that anybody who heard the speeches made from diverse parts of the House with different political viewpoints could not but be moved by what was said
The Commission through its delegation in Washington is looking into the circumstances of the medical condition of Mr Peltier and will do its utmost to support the actions of the European Parliament in this regard
We will carefully follow up this case and look forward to the exchanges on this issue at the next meeting between the European Parliament Delegation for relations with the United States and the United States Congress
Not only is it legitimate that this subject should be discussed but in the circumstances described it is inevitable and natural
On the question of freedom of religion I am glad that it has been broadened out and has not concentrated entirely on the situation in India because it is right to say that there are problems to put it mildly with regard to freedom of religion in many countries and it would be misleading to focus only on India
As far as we are concerned freedom of religion is a fundamental human right and we should defend it wherever it comes under attack
Nonetheless there has been a certain topicality with regard to the reports about attacks on Christians in India which are deeply worrying
The Commission delegation which continues to keep us fully informed on the situation as it develops is fully associated with Member States missions in monitoring the situation
Sadly ethnic and religious violence is not a novelty in India but violence against Christians on the scale reported is new
The issue is now highly politicised in India and it has the potential to affect the political situation there reference has been made to the statement by the Prime Minister which of course we have noted
The issue is dividing not only Opposition and Government but is also controversial within the BJP itself
There is no doubt that the principle of secular government and the protection of minorities is deeply ingrained in Indian democratic tradition
There can also be no doubt that opinion leaders and civil society in India are deeply shocked about the events and the damage done to India image and that is amply reflected by the wide press coverage which these events have received since they began
The Commission is convinced that responsible Indian politicians together with a strong consensus in civil society can succeed in mobilising the necessary political momentum to control violence
We strongly support the continuation of the quiet and persistent work of our representatives on the ground our ambassadors NGOs and concerned Indian citizens as the best guarantee to check the current situation and for that they were recently thanked by the Archbishops of Delhi Mumbai and Bangalore
The Commission fully endorses the objectives of racial tolerance social harmony and full respect for human rights which underpin the European Parliament motion for a resolution
The debate is closed
The vote will take place at pm
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions on the situation in Guinea-Bissau
B on behalf of the UPE GroupB on behalf of the ELDR GroupB on behalf of the PPE GroupB on behalf of the V GroupB on behalf of the PSE GroupB on behalf of the GUENGL GroupB on behalf of the ARE Group
Mr President the situation in the West African state of Guinea-Bissau is extremely worrying
After the November agreement and the new agreement at the start of this year violence has broken out once again between the troops of President Vieira and General Ansumane Mane
The conflict of June has returned and people are once again fleeing in large numbers
The civilian population are suffering yet again as a result of the destruction caused by this war
The Abuja peace agreement has been suspended and the foreign troops are committing countless human rights violations
It is extremely important that the Abuja agreement should once again be applied in full
All foreign troops except of course for the ECOMOG forces must leave the country and the government of national unity must try to organise proper elections which would be an almost unprecedented event
Europe must be prepared to do something to help here
Great efforts are needed in West Africa to prevent conflicts from spilling over into other countries
There are far too many transnational conflicts
We must do everything we can to prevent the proliferation of light weapons and the Union must offer ECOMOG technical and financial support and humanitarian aid for the people
Mr President Commissioner war has returned to Guinea-Bissau
The European Parliament must show its solidarity with the people of Guinea-Bissau who are suffering in this civil war
Hundreds of people have died thousands of civilian refugees have had to leave their country hospitals are short of medical supplies and are struggling to cope and hunger and disease are spreading
There was an agreement in Abuja which provided for a cease-fire and arrangements to contain the conflict
Despite this military operations have started again and everything points to this being the responsibility of President Vieira troops
We deplore the political irresponsibility and shortsightedness of political and military leaders who put their own interests above the interests of their people
The European Parliament must demand respect for the Abuja agreements which provide for the formation of a government of national unity and the organisation of presidential and legislative elections respecting the independence and territorial integrity of Guinea-Bissau
There is a danger that the conflict will become international given the situation in Casamanca
The presence of foreign troops notably from Senegal and the Republic of Guinea whom international human rights organisations are accusing of human rights violations against civilians is aggravating that danger
So the withdrawal of all foreign troops is a fundamental prerequisite for restoring peace
The only troops that should stay to guarantee the cease-fire and ensure compliance with the agreements are the ECOMOG troops
The people of Guinea-Bissau desperately need help and this means strengthening humanitarian aid and ensuring that aid actually reaches the people who need it
Here I would stress the importance of neutral non-governmental organisations operating on the ground
Finally I call on the European Union to support the efforts of the Prime Minister designate Francisco Fabu to establish a government of national unity capable above all of serving the interests of the long-suffering people of Guinea-Bissau
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen what is happening in Guinea-Bissau is tragic There are thousands of displaced persons and widespread hunger and misery caused by a war which it seems nobody wants and is of no use to anyone
It is vital to restore peace and to silence the guns in Guinea-Bissau
It is vital to observe the Abuja agreement and rapidly establish ECOMOG the peace-keeping force of the Economic Community of West African States
President João Bernardo Vieira and General Mané have to bear the heavy responsibility of enabling and ensuring compliance with the agreement they have signed by stabilising the situation in Guinea-Bissau installing the new government of national unity organising free elections and allowing the country to develop
Europe can and must help and that is what our compromise resolution is about
Humanitarian aid and technical and financial support are needed but we can also help by firmly condemning the escalation of the war and demanding the immediate withdrawal of the foreign military forces involved in the conflict
Without that withdrawal the human rights abuses will continue and peace will not be possible
In this case Parliament recommendation that the Council should speak with one voice on this matter is very apposite
And given much of the news published in the media I would like to ask if the Commission can give Parliament any information guaranteeing that there are no military forces from any Member State of the Union involved in this sad conflict which we hope to see ended as rapidly as possible
Mr President Commissioner first I would like to welcome this joint motion for a resolution and stress our joint condemnation of the new wave of violence in Guinea-Bissau and our demand for full implementation of the cease-fire agreed on February
Recent events have frustrated the hopes raised by the Abuja agreement of November hopes that the conflict might be over and that Guinea-Bissau and especially its martyred people might enjoy the peace needed to recover from a situation of enormous economic backwardness aggravated by the destruction and chaos provoked by the conflict which broke out last June
That hope must be urgently rekindled above all in the Guineans who have witnessed and been victims of this senseless confrontation which can only be ended through negotiation peace and respect for the agreements
We also want to highlight and denounce the destabilising role of foreign troops since the beginning of the conflict That role is all the more serious because it may be one reason why the Abuja agreement is not being respected
Withdrawal of all foreign military forces not in the territory in strict compliance with that agreement like the troops from Senegal and the Republic of Guinea is a prerequisite for implementing the agreement and for the government of national unity to take office in line with that agreement
The West African intervention force has a peace-keeping mission and that mission must not be complicated by other foreign forces hindering its action or pursuing other purposes
This conflict must not be turned into some kind of cockfight for the only perch in the chicken coop
A political solution must be found which guarantees peace respects what has already been agreed does not undermine the independence and territorial integrity of Guinea-Bissau and puts an end to a tragic situation which is destroying a country and a people
Initiatives to bring humanitarian aid particularly food and medical aid to the people are urgently needed and should be welcomed and encouraged
Mr President Commissioner it is a sad fact that the situation in various parts of Africa brings one question to mind how far can the absurd the ridiculous and the irrational go
Guinea-Bissau is one of the poorest countries in the world Before the recent conflict that began eight months ago it had an average per capita income of around USD which is equivalent to less than half an ecu per person per day
The situation was beginning to improve The country was starting to see an increase in reserves inflation was falling and annual growth stood at %
This has all disappeared over the last eight months
The country will now have negative growth in other words over the next few months the annual growth rate will be %
The war there was undoubtedly the result of the conflicting ambitions of a president who seems to have been in power for ever and an ambitious general As we know it has left the country in a situation in which its citizens are fleeing some are becoming refugees people are starving and its limited reserves have been squandered
The conflict is even becoming international with the clear involvement of troops from Senegal moving from the conflict in the southern region of Casamance as well as troops from the Republic of Guinea
There is no doubt that the international community must do everything in its power to try to put an end to this situation We must be able to restart the aid programme that the international bodies had launched and which has once again been paralysed
We must ensure that foreign troops are withdrawn and that only the ECOMOG peacekeeping forces remain Finally given that the cease-fire that was renewed in February only a few days ago in fact has already been broken we must provide the Prime Minister designate with the power he needs to allow the people of Guinea-Bissau to resolve their future in peace
Mr President I can be comparatively brief because the Commission shares the view set out in Parliament proposed resolution
We are closely monitoring developments in Guinea-Bissau and are aware of the tremendous difficulties faced by the civilian population
Through ECHO we are providing I hope speedy and effective humanitarian assistance to meet the population needs
We also support the mediation efforts currently underway and call on the parties involved in the conflict to comply with the Abuja agreement
We are ready to resume cooperation with Guinea-Bissau once democracy has been restored
We are aware of the role played by ECOWAS in the international community efforts to maintain stability in the region and we support the Abuja agreement including the deployment of ECOMOG troops in Guinea-Bissau
Reference has been made to the suggestion that troops of some Member States are participating
I am aware of those rumours but I am not in a position either to confirm or to deny them
We are consulting Member States however on ways to finance aid in the form of supplies and non-military equipment for the ECOMOG forces
The joint debate is closed
The vote will be taken at pm
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions concerning natural disasters
Storms in the Canary Islands
B by Mrs Sierra González and others on behalf of the GUENGL GroupB by Mr Escolá Hernando and others on behalf of the ARE GroupB by Mr Medina Ortega on behalf of the PSE GroupB by Mr Fernández Martín and others on behalf of the PPE Group Earthquake in Colombia
B by Mr Newens on behalf of the PSE GroupB by Mr Puerta and others on behalf of the GUENGL GroupB by Mrs Banotti and others on behalf of the PPE GroupStorms in the Canary Islands
Mr President the order of speakers was not really very important
What we are talking about here is the catastrophe that devastated the Canary Islands and I must point out that this catastrophe adds to the problem of the region ultraperipheral location
The storms affected its entire port and coastal infrastructures as well as its agriculture in other words the tomato and banana crops which are fundamental for the region economy
We do not need the full minute we have been allocated as we merely want to urge the Commission to make additional efforts in its structural programmes to help this remote region to overcome this catastrophe It is called a natural catastrophe although we may soon have to consider the fact that such catastrophes are not so natural and that they are sometimes the result of the damage we have done to the environment
Mr President ladies and gentlemen Commissioner at the beginning of January a violent storm struck the islands of Tenerife Gran Canaria Palma and Hierro doing untold damage to port infrastructure coastal roads and shore installations
It also affected the tomato and banana crops and other fruit and horticultural production
As these are islands there is no alternative infrastructure so it is vital to the life of the archipelago for it to be in full operation
Agricultural production in the islands in amounted to million pesetas and the damage to agricultural production represents % of the damage to infrastructure and about % of turnover
Furthermore the largest tomato producers in the Canary Islands have suffered damage amounting to million pesetas equivalent to % of production and the damage in the banana sector amounts to million pesetas corresponding to % of production while damage to infrastructure amounts to million pesetas
That is why we are asking the Commission to check the extent of the damage quickly and to include the Canary Islands and specific projects for repairing damage caused to the coastal infrastructure in the Union structural programmes
We are also concerned about the effects of the storm on the turnover of agricultural producers for and consequently on the Canary Islands economy and we call on the Commission to provide the aid necessary to mitigate the damage suffered in this sector
Ladies and gentlemen while I have the floor I want to take the opportunity to express my deep sadness at the news of the devastation caused by the Colombian earthquake of January which is said to be the worst earthquake to have struck the country this century killing over a thousand people and injuring countless others most of them from the poorest communities in the region
So I want to express the solidarity of the Group of the European Radical Alliance with the victims and the families of the dead and with the people of Colombia
According to news from the area the Colombian army apparently faced great difficulty despite sending thousands of soldiers to the region in preventing widespread looting in the city of Armenia where the looters fired on the rescuers and public disorder is hindering rescue operations
There is also the danger of corruption which may also prevent all the international aid reaching the people it is actually intended for
So I urge President Pastrana and the Colombian Government to take firm measures to restore public order in the disaster areas while respecting human rights and to take all measures necessary to ensure that emergency aid reaches its proper destination
But most of all I hope this terrible event will not disturb the peace process under way in Colombia which is already difficult enough
Finally Mr President I also want to express our satisfaction that the Commission made EUR million available immediately including EUR million not spent last year and to applaud the constructive cooperation of the Red Cross Oxfam and other NGOs operating in the region
And I call on the Commission and the Governments of the Member States to cooperate with the appropriate NGOs in making every possible effort to resolve this crisis and to implement a special development programme to meet the mediumand long-term needs of the earthquake zone
Thank you Mr Posada
Of course you did not mention just the problems of the Canaries but those of Columbia as well which is the next item on the agenda
Mr President we are fortunate that Commissioner Brittan is present here with us because last night he took the trouble to stay here until midnight to discuss an issue that is very closely related to the ultraperipheral regions and the Canary Islands that is the banana industry
Mr Brittan I am addressing you directly because if you read our motion for a resolution you will see that it relates to the serious damage that has been caused to agriculture in the Canary Islands
To be specific and although this is not mentioned in the motion for a resolution I can tell you that as far as banana production is concerned there has been so much damage that neither in nor in will we come close to the minimum guaranteed production of tonnes per year
This is because not only parent banana trees but also young banana trees were destroyed I am telling you this because when we hold talks in Washington with a government that talks about defending free competition I think we should let them know that our banana plantations have to contend with adverse climatic conditions and that in some regions of the Community both in the West Indies and in the Canary Islands and Madeira such catastrophes often occur
I believe that this is an important argument
However the aim of the resolution we are moving is rather different
I would like to read something unusual to the Commissioner as I think it is very interesting
It comes from the Las Palmas newspaper La Provincia today February which states that the representative of the federation of fruit and vegetable exporters in Las Palmas Roberto Góiriz welcomed the agreement that the European Parliament is about to adopt and pointed out that it would be an institution based in Strasbourg that would eventually find the solution to a problem that affects everyone living there
It is unusual that regions as remote as our own now look to the Commission as a source of inspiration and a source of aid
The Commission has always been very receptive to the problems experienced in these regions
We are now asking among other things that it should implement as soon as possible the new Article of the Treaty of Amsterdam which provides for special measures for these regions precisely because of the adverse conditions affecting their economies
Mr President I am speaking on behalf of Mr Fernández Martín as he has had to leave
As has already been pointed out and as you are all aware at the beginning of January the Canary Islands were hit by a violent storm that has led to significant economic losses in terms of both infrastructure and agricultural production
I must emphasise that the losses do not just translate to the significant figures contained in the resolution of around EUR million between the banana and tomato crops which as you know form the basis of the region economy a fact that has been highlighted In addition to these losses there were also significant losses in terms of infrastructures totalling approximately EUR million
We therefore call on the relevant institutions within the European Union and particularly the Commission to take account of the scale of the destruction and to launch specific projects to remedy the damage caused to the infrastructures We also ask that adequate measures be taken to provide effective and rapid aid to the people affected by this catastrophe and to the regional government to repair the damage that was caused
Earthquake in Colombia
Mr President the tragedy caused by the earthquakes in the Colombian regions of Pereira and Armenia come on top of other violent catastrophes that have destroyed people and property in Central America and parts of the Caribbean
Europe response in every instance has been rapid and united This has allowed us to alleviate some of the devastation and bring a little hope to the victims
Clearly the extreme circumstances affecting Columbia were aggravated by the destruction of infrastructures which delayed the arrival of aid and the implementation of the emergency plans
It is therefore extremely regrettable that some unscrupulous people are exploiting the tragedy to rob steal and trade in the scarce resources that were already in the region or that were able to get through
Nonetheless these regrettable facts must not overshadow the heroic acts or the excellent example of civic-mindedness demonstrated by the non-governmental organisations the civilian population anonymous individuals and the army who are all involved in the recovery and rescue operations
We must highlight their positive responses as well as the rapid reaction of ECHO and the European Commission in distributing the aid that is so important at the moment I congratulate them on that
After the damage has been assessed we will have to follow up the present project with a further programme aimed at helping the recovery of those regions that have been totally devastated
Unfortunately we can do nothing for those who have disappeared apart from extending our condolences to their families Indeed there is very little we can do to predict other earthquakes
However we can see to it that the donations from European and other countries are used as transparently and effectively as possible so as to prevent any doubts about embezzlement or the misuse of the funds
I would like to end by saying that this resolution supports the commitment made by President Pastrana to combat corruption We call on his government to make every effort to guarantee security in the region and respect for human rights
Mr President there is very little I can add to what our colleague Ana Miranda de Lage has just said on this issue
In my view the same thing has happened with this earthquake in Columbia as happened with Hurricane Mitch As usual it is the poorest people that are affected
More than people have died and many have been injured
In my opinion we must first of all welcome the rapid response of the European Commission in releasing EUR million which is a considerable amount and its work in collaboration with non-governmental organisations such as the Red Cross Oxfam and others
It is important for the European Commission to guarantee in some way that the aid sent reaches those who are genuinely affected
On previous occasions a certain section of the population has taken advantage of the confusion as is now the case and exploited the breakdown in public order to use or sell goods that were intended for those who were most severely affected There have also been cases where the aid was not distributed as it should have been and did not reach those most in need
So the European Commission can perhaps play an important role in this respect
We must also welcome the fact that Mr Pastrana has made a commitment to eliminate corruption and that while those most in need are receiving aid human rights are being respected in Columbia
Mr President I can certainly subscribe to the previous speakers remarks on behalf of my group
It is not the first time that Colombia has been hit by such a great disaster and on this occasion it appears to have occurred in a part of Colombia with relatively few problems
It is all the more tragic that a region inhabited by people who though dependent on help had hitherto managed to eke out a decent living has now been struck by such a disaster
Our urgent plea to the Commission is that it should cut through the red tape wherever possible that it should ensure as far as possible that the aid goes directly to the people in need
We are pleased that action has been taken so quickly since we often criticise Colombia here
It is our biggest headache in several respects as you well know Commissioner
I believe that if we can take this occasion to show clearly to Colombia and President Pastrana that we are also capable of constructive intervention when practical humanitarian assistance is needed we shall have achieved a great deal
Mr President in joining in the expressions of sympathy for the victims of the Colombian earthquake let us ensure that the European Union provides the long-term assistance required to help people rebuild their lives
Still today the communities affected lack basic storage containers for clean water have too few latrines or waterproof shelters and not enough equipment for food preparation or tools to help clear and reconstruct their homes
Barefoot children lack shoes to climb over the rubble of their former homes and lives have been destroyed
Though agencies like Oxfam are seeking to help families per month over people have lost their belongings or their livelihoods
We must learn the lessons too for despite the early announcement of assistance which we welcome no international aid had arrived locally a full hours after the earthquake struck
Finally in a situation which should unify the disparate groups in the Colombian conflict for absolutely clear humanitarian reasons I have to express disbelief at reports that paramilitaries may have used the disaster to cover the killing of human rights defenders in the NGOs in Colombia and that it may have been the pretext for withdrawing a bill condemning forced disappearances at an extraordinary session in the Colombian Parliament last week
We call on President Pastrana not simply to attack fraud and corruption but also to promulgate that bill
The twenty-fifth of January is a date which will be etched in the memory of the Colombian people but regrettably for the wrong reasons
It was a tragedy of immense proportions as has already been pointed out resulting in over one thousand deaths and many thousands more being injured
It must be said that the Commission is to be congratulated on the speed with which it responded to the crisis and in particular the way in which it cooperated with NGOs in the region
However the aid sent from the European Union and other donor countries is a mere token given the scale of the destruction and suffering and particularly in view of a statistic mentioned by Mr Howitt almost half a million people have lost their homes and their belongings
Therefore a very comprehensive aid and development programme is required to meet the long-term needs of the country and its people
It is vitally important that if this aid is forthcoming it is properly coordinated and channelled to those who need it most
The resolution is right to point out the danger of corruption and the need to eliminate it
I welcome as does the resolution President Pastrana commitment to ensure that this does not happen
The resolution is also right to point out that in trying to restore public order it is vitally important that human rights are not violated
Mr President everyday life in Colombia is grim
Every month we could discuss the latest human rights violations the paramilitaries attacks on the Indios and the black population people driven from their homes and the disappearance of individuals
This time however the cause of our concern is what we call a natural disaster namely the earthquake in the city of Armenia
It has heaped untold suffering on the population and I do not propose to repeat everything my honourable colleagues have already said on the subject Nevertheless the natural disaster has been compounded by a home-made disaster in the form of corruption and incompetence partly within the Colombian government apparatus which are hindering the effort to ensure that help reaches the victims and reaches them quickly
We must be particularly worried by reports that the allegedly rapid assistance provided by the European Union has failed to arrive in many places
There is an urgent need to find out how accurate this information is
An official report on this matter is urgently required
In the wake of the earthquake the paramilitaries have launched a campaign to annihilate human rights activists
Politicians and others at home and abroad insist that it is high time President Andrés Pastrana took decisive action
Alas we have seen too little of that
Here too there is an urgent need for the Commission to demand that the Colombian Government act to stamp out these violations of human rights in the aftermath of the earthquake
Mr President dealing first with the situation in the Canary Islands the Commission is well aware of the terrible storms which hit the islands between and January
I am grateful for the further information supplied by the honourable Members in their resolution and also in the speeches that have been made
As far as the issue of bananas is concerned I am well aware of the particular role that industry plays in the economy of the Canary Islands and have particular sympathy for what has occurred coupled with the other problems which we dealt with last night
I would like to express the Commission sympathy and support for the local population affected by the storms
We are very sensitive to the difficulties that have arisen as a result and we will be looking carefully at the situation as a whole in the light of the instruments and regulatory provisions that may be available to give assistance
So that those involved can make a proper study for the Commission what we would like the Spanish authorities to do is to provide as soon as possible detailed information about the nature of the severe weather its impact on production and production potential in the region as well as the damage caused to the infrastructure
If we receive a formal request from the Spanish Government at the next meeting of the monitoring committees for structural assistance in the Canary Islands and the Objective Community Support Framework for Spain we will look into the possibilities of reprogramming current structural assistance in partnership with the national and regional authorities as well as any allocation from other resources available as a contribution to repairing the infrastructures damaged by the storms in question
Turning to the situation in Colombia preliminary official figures show that the number of dead has risen to over of whom are in the Department of Quindio and the number of injured to approximately and persons are homeless
Clearly the immediate priority is to respond to the emergency needs of the most vulnerable sections of the population throughout the region hit by the disaster
A detailed needs assessment confirms that it is essential to provide temporary shelter food blankets kitchen utensils medicines and chlorine as a matter of urgency
Pending a more exhaustive analysis of needs a relief programme amounting to EUR million has so far been prepared by ECHO
The Commission was able to announce on January a timely contribution to international relief efforts and I am grateful for the kind words that have been spoken this afternoon about what the Commission has been able to do
This first contingency plan is being implemented by various European NGOs in cooperation with the Colombian Red Cross
ECHO is considering the adoption of a further relief programme for the victims of the earthquake
In the context of their mission to Colombia next week the Commission services will begin to study possibilities for the long-term rehabilitation of the earthquake areas
But I would add that we fully share the view expressed in the European Parliament that President Pastrana government must take steps to restore public order and combat corruption whilst fully respecting human rights and should ensure that the killing and kidnapping of human rights activists and of local NGO workers is fully investigated and the results of any such investigation are acted upon with firmness and speed
The debate is closed
The vote will take place today at pm
In view of the fact that the debate has ended early and we cannot proceed immediately to the vote I am obliged to suspend the sitting until voting time
The sitting was suspended at pm and resumed at pm
We now come to the vote on topical and urgent debate
After the vote on the joint motion on Kazakhstan
Mr President I congratulate the House on its unanimous adoption of the resolution on Kazakhstan
I have the German version in front of me
It consists only of the following phrase beauftragt seinen Präsidenten diese Entschließung an die und die weiterzuleiten instructs its President to forward this resolution to such-and-such
The only other thing on this sheet is two straight lines
I just wanted to ask whether others have read the resolution and whether their versions contain the text
Mr President I have to say that my previous remark was not meant as a joke but as a formal protest
The resolution on Kazakhstan at least in the German version consists of two straight lines
Laughter
May I ask you to declare the vote null and void
According to our Rules of Procedure a vote is invalid if the text is not available
Failure to annul this vote would establish a precedent
Mr President that is not the case
There is a complete version of the German text
Perhaps you have been given the wrong sheet Mr Posselt
I will gladly provide you with a copy so that you know exactly what you voted for
Mr Swoboda I have also been shown a full version
I was suggesting to Mr Posselt that there was something wrong with the printing in the version he had obtained
Mr President could it be that an honourable Member of the Christian Social Union has one or two blind spots
Laughter
Surely not
VOTES continuation
Mr President I wish to make one or two points about the vote
Firstly I apologise that there are more than amendments we tried as best we could to reduce the number
I should like to explain the meaning of compromise amendments in connection with tonight vote
They are not compromise amendments in the way we normally understand them that is to say compromise amendments between political groups They represent the results of an informal trialogue which took place in Brussels over the last couple of days and weeks and amount to a considerable amount of work put in by myself and the other water rapporteurs
It is absolutely imperative that we having agreed those compromise amendments between the water rapporteurs now agree to endorse them because the German presidency which was not represented at last night debate has stated in a letter The German presidency is hoping to achieve a common position on the draft directive at the March Council
They will do their best to include in that common position the text that came out of the informal consultations
A prerequisite will be that this text is included in the decision on the proposal that Parliament will be taking tonight
So we need to fulfil our side of the bargain endorse the so-called compromise amendments and then we have the beginnings of something we can take further after the second reading when we move to co-decision
Mr President at the end of the votes this morning I requested that the vote on this report be postponed to the next part-session in Brussels
I would like to repeat this request given the importance of this report and ask that the vote be taken in Brussels
You are quite correct that the point was raised this morning but the Rules say that it either has to be a political group or Members
I have had no formal request from any of the political groups or any wish expressed by members
So I intend to take the vote
With good will I do not think it will take us very long
Mr President I wonder whether the political groups which are asking for so many roll call votes are aware that each roll-call vote costs the European taxpayer EUR 
Mr President may I simply ask the questioner whether he knows how important it is for the public to know who bears political responsibility and how much that knowledge is worth
Mr President there is not the slightest doubt that our citizens have the right to know and we are under an obligation to inform them But not about every proposal and every political group
Colleagues we have had a long week and we are all tired
Let us move on
Mr President I merely wanted to reassure the honourable Member
We are all in favour of budgetary thrift Mr Anastassopoulos and when I cast my eye over your group and see all the empty seats it is clear that many Members will only receive half of their per diem allowance today which will no doubt please you
Laughter
I am tempted to have a roll-call vote on whether roll-call votes are worthwhile but that would be absurd
Parliament adopted the legislative resolution
Mr President this has been a very long and complicated vote but it is a very satisfactory conclusion
However I want to draw the House attention to the fact that firstly it was made necessary by the fact that the Council reached a political agreement on this at a very early stage
This is an example of the unwisdom of the Council in reaching these political agreements
Secondly the satisfactory result would not have been possible without the immense work by Mr White
But I want to stress that it would not have been possible without the cooperation of his fellow rapporteurs on water Mr Eisma and Mr Florenz it would not have been possible without the coordinators of all the political groups it would not have been possible without close cooperation with Commission staff with the chairman of the German presidency Working Group on Water and without the secretariat of the Environment Committee
I hope that people recognise these people are due recognition because without them Mr White would not have been so successful
I am glad to hear the water directive was overflowing with cooperation
Mr President I am interested in the number of roll call votes we have been having on this report
In the vote on the previous report you always identified the group which called for the roll call vote which caused some discomfort for our colleagues in the Green Group
In this instance not once have you identified who has asked for the roll call vote
Surely we should be told who has asked for a roll call vote
Mr President I should like to point out to the House that in Amendment No in the second indent of point a the German wording entfernen pyrotechnische Komponenten must be replaced by neutralisieren pyrotechnische Komponenten in order to make the wording consistent with the rest of the legislative text
In an engineering dissertation the wording would be excellent but it is entirely unsuitable for a legislative text
As the rapporteur confirms that we will ensure that the German text is amended accordingly
Parliament adopted the legislative resolution
I have received a request under Rule from the Group of the United Left to refer this report back to committee
Mr President on behalf of the Group of the Confederal Group of the European United Left Nordic Green Left I request that the Quisthoudt-Rowohl report should be referred back to committee under Rule for the following reasons we think the adoption of the report at this time may be interpreted as interference in the electoral processes of a sovereign state Israel and regardless of its merits or intentions as explicit support for one of the more controversial parties in the election specifically that of candidate Benjamin Netanyahu
Mr President if we had to refer the reports back every time there were elections in the countries concerned we would no longer vote on any reports
I therefore do not believe that we can refer this report back
Applause
Mr President I believe we should vote on this report now
Any delay would be detrimental to Israel as well as to the Palestinians
Parliament decided against referral back to committee
Parliament adopted the legislative resolution
Mr President I just wanted to table an oral amendment but one that I feel is appropriate
I propose that after the words regional integration we add through the abolition a priori of the principle of non-reciprocity in ACPOCTUPR relations as soon as the new EUACP general agreement enters into force so as to provide us with a better understanding of the amendment
Mr President the Socialist Group supports Mr Aldo motion for a resolution in general terms However the oral amendment he is proposing is quite serious so we cannot accept it at this stage
It is not a simple formal amendment its content is very significant
We therefore oppose the oral amendment
More than Members indicated their opposition to the oral amendment
Parliament adopted the resolution
In the st century good quality water will perhaps be of greater strategic importance than oil which is a good reason for thanking Mr White for the efforts he is making now to ensure that we have good quality surface water by 
The river basin approach enables the Member States to pursue policies which are specifically tailored to river basins which we think is an excellent idea
If the best use is made of local knowledge such as the water boards can provide it will help to achieve better results
Involving those who are directly concerned makes it much more likely that new policies will be accepted
Establishing a new framework directive is certainly going to take some doing the way it was dealt with at first reading was extremely confusing
Our examination of the draft framework directive was postponed several times mainly because of the premature position that the Council adopted last June
All in all it was a strange state of affairs
After that with the Amsterdam Treaty in mind progress started to be made towards reaching a political agreement though this has only been successful in a small number of areas because certain Member States refuse to be flexible
This is a pity because it is often much easier to reach agreement at an early stage before opinions become too firmly entrenched
The compromise amendments which I and others have tabled are a rather disappointing result after a very promising start
Amendments Nos to on the wetlands are designed to maintain a buffer water capacity which is essential in order to prevent floods and drought
Compromise Amendments Nos and take account of the fact that the protection of marine waters is already covered by international agreements
We are in favour of organising occasional conferences on water policy which all parties concerned including NGOs should be able to attend as proposed in Amendment No 
The re-injection of water for certain necessary activities must still be possible provided that it is done in a responsible manner and Amendment No creates adequate safeguards here
With the emission limit values all the various sources must be considered not just the major polluters
The difficulty here is in enforcing the polluter pays principle and we therefore wonder whether Amendments Nos and can really be implemented in practice
The Commission proposal establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy is a reworking and combination of a number of directives currently in force on the quality of surface and bathing waters waters used for fish and shellfish farming and waters for human consumption on the protection and management of groundwater the treatment of municipal waste water control of effluent and pollution by nitrates
In addition to simplifying the situation the main new feature of this proposal for a directive is its underlying approach which is based on the notion of river basins
Good management of these will ensure that the quantity and quality of surface and groundwater are safeguarded whether these waters belong to one Member State only or straddle a border
By the end of the year the Commission is to put forward technical specifications which will form the basis for all data collection and analysis operations notably regarding the definition of river basin districts and the analysis of their physical demographic and economic characteristics analysis and monitoring of water quality and the evaluation of water quantity and quality
Each management plan will consist of a programme of measures to be fully operational by December at the latest
The objective of good status must be achieved by the year 
Responsibility for implementing these requirements will very largely rest with the Member States
In response to this proposal I tabled amendments on behalf of the Europe of Nations Group most of which were adopted either on their own or as part of a compromise amendment
These amendments naturally included wetlands and their specific ecosystem in the context of these Community measures
But we also pointed to the importance of agriculture and the specific link between this industry and water
We needed to take account of the special features of agriculture to ensure that it was not restricted by too bureaucratic an approach
We voted against compromise Amendment No on the underground storage of natural gas and LPG
The Commission proposal introduces a derogation for existing stores but would ban any plan to develop further storage of natural gas in aquifers whilst the French experience of storing gas underground since and LPG in abandoned mine workings since indicates that all requisite measures for protecting the environment are in place
We did however vote for Amendment No which authorises underground storage where this does not compromise the environmental objectives of this directive
This directive recognises the importance of the advances in certain areas and therefore concentrates on the quality of water leaving aside the quantitative aspects of the problem
There is a serious shortage of water in southern countries which means that it is becoming a limited resource
We must therefore restrict the temptation in wealthier more developed and more powerful regions to transfer water from other areas as is the case with the River Ebro
Through Amendments Nos and the White report puts an end to such practices by limiting this water policy
I was therefore happy to vote in favour of these amendments and the entire report
To begin with we should welcome today adoption at first reading of this framework directive on water policy which Parliament has been pressing for hard for a long time
This text will clarify and simplify the existing Community legislation which is fragmented and labyrinthine
Secondly I must deplore once again the fact that political agreement was reached in the Council before Parliament had had its say
Moreover after his report was adopted by the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Consumer Protection Mr White outside all the normal channels of official procedure negotiated compromise amendments with the representatives of the Council
I find it most regrettable that he did not take the trouble to inform the Committee on the Environment at any stage of his dealings
Over and above that I deplore the fact that he added on his own initiative a thirteenth Amendment No which was never agreed with the Council delegation
The rapporteur made this addition without respecting the elementary rules of transparency and without even consulting the authors of the amendments which his compromise proposal was designed to replace
This is no way to do things
On principle therefore and also because the content of Amendment No was not consistent with the wishes of the PPE Group we voted against this amendment
Despite Mr White best efforts his attempt to reduce the number of amendments to this text as far as possible only succeeded with the Council on points which whilst useful were thought to be of minor importance
We have had to vote in today sitting on nearly amendments
That proves Mr President that Parliament is using the powers granted it under the Treaty despite the dubious practices employed by the Council of Ministers
A good environment in rivers and streams is an important element in the overall quality of the environment in the European Union
However the highly intensive exploitation of freshwater resources that has taken place over the past years has created major problems for animal and plant life in European rivers
It is therefore gratifying that the Commission has taken the initiative of a directive establishing a framework for EU action in the field of water policy
The Commission proposals for a phased solution to the dual problems of pollution and supply bear witness to a legislative proposal that has been prepared with great care
Through the discussion in Parliament and the Council I hope that it will be possible to satisfy the demands of both the environment and supply
Florenz report A
This explanation of vote is mainly concerned with those sections of the report dealing with PVC
Although we appreciate that PVC is not the only issue here we are ready to back those amendments which seek either to ban or to restrict the use of PVC
We naturally support reduced use of traditional PVC but we do feel that today technology offers ever more ways of cutting back on those component substances in PVC that are a danger to the environment and health
We also know that industry and in particular the automobile sector is working actively on many fronts to find alternatives to PVC or to use less hazardous forms of it
We therefore hope that the Commission will very soon come forward with a proposal for a directive on the whole issue of PVC without this being restricted to any particular sector
As to the disposal of PVC we believe that the optimum solution is reuse or recycling the second-best choice would be incineration coupled with energy production
Landfill has to be seen as the option of last resort
Adopting Amendment No fails in our opinion to do justice to the important area of producer liability
We therefore voted against this amendment
The following order of priorities is used in the treatment of waste in the European Union prevention reuse recycling incineration and landfill
The same order must therefore also be used in disposing of vehicles particularly when we consider that there are huge numbers of end-of-life vehicles each year and that the first priority must be to ensure that the dangerous substances they contain are given appropriate treatment
As regards the prevention of PVC waste we feel that this would be better dealt with in a horizontal directive and we are expecting a proposal from the Commission on this shortly
This is why we voted against Amendments Nos and 
The best way of ensuring successful collection is to enable the last owner to deliver the vehicle to an authorised treatment facility free of charge
The treatment costs can then be passed on in the price of new vehicles
In many countries however it happens all too often that vehicles are dumped illegally even in surface water with all that this implies
We voted for Amendments Nos to even though they do not take adequate measures to prevent these problems from happening
The existing arrangements for the collection of two and three-wheeled vehicles must be left in place and it is therefore a good idea to exclude them from Article 
We voted for Amendment No despite the fact that all the provisions on prevention reuse and recovery have been dropped
On the subject of treatment we wholeheartedly supported Amendment No and the same applies to Amendment No on the percentages for reuse and recovery
As everyone probably knows the complete dismantling of end-of-life vehicles is currently possible and economically viable
This would mean a reduction in the shredding of such vehicles
The targets set out in Amendment No are certainly attainable in the Netherlands for example we have already reached %
We are in favour of Member States concluding agreements with the economic actors concerned so that the directive can be implemented flexibly
I am glad that the European Commission and Parliament are at last planning to legislate on the recycling and proper disposal of end-of-life vehicles
Motor vehicles are one of the most important areas of capitalist production
In the European Union as we approach the year close on million vehicles are scrapped every year
To quote just one of the many eloquent figures the non-recyclable waste which remains after crushing and shredding makes up % of the total volume of hazardous waste
In the case of vehicles and other major consumer items a fundamental principle could usefully be adopted on a large scale The producer should also be made responsible for disposing of and recycling his products
The purchase price would of course reflect the cost of this responsibility
In this way numerous pollutants often harmful to the environment would be eliminated and this would enable the process of recycling and disposal to be organised more efficiently
European standards should be put in place for the various product categories to regulate their collection processing reuse recycling and the monitoring of these operations
I think this idea will also enable many pollutants to be eliminated at the production stage since the producer himself will have to make provision for recycling his products in the simplest and safest way possible
First of all I must compliment Mr Florenz on his good work
This text is of prime importance to the environment
Sadly we are all familiar with the eyesore of abandoned car wrecks on our landscapes
This proposal is very important too for producers in the industry concerned
There are many sectors directly involved in the treating of end-of-life motor vehicles the car makers the suppliers of parts and fittings the plastics and metal components sector the recycling and salvage professionals and so on
Consumers the current or future owners of a vehicle are of course the people primarily concerned on what terms will their vehicles be taken back and treated
We ought not to be dogmatic here
Taking back vehicles free of charge as envisaged here is to my mind a snare
The real cost of collecting free of charge an old vehicle which does not comply with recent environmental standards will have to be met sooner or later
The intention of my Amendment No was to make it compulsory for vehicles type-approved after the date of the directive entry into force to be taken back free of charge
At the same time Member States would have to provide incentives so that all vehicles could in fact be taken back free of charge
With the same ideas in mind I supported the proposal by the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Consumer Protection which seeks to set differentiated objectives according to whether the vehicle is an old one or one which meets the standards of the present directive
I also feel strongly about the amendments seeking to ban the use of PVC
Firstly there is no way one can suggest banning the use of a material in a horizontal text on end-of-life vehicles
Secondly we have to be consistent this House has always strongly advocated measures to control atmospheric pollution
In that context it encourages the use of light materials in vehicle construction so as to reduce fuel consumption
At present given that there are no alternative materials it is neither meaningful nor realistic to seek a ban on the use of PVC in motor vehicle construction
I naturally welcome any proposal which aims to improve waste management in the European Union
Clearly the waste which results from lack of control in the motor industry has become unacceptable and measures are needed to address the problem
To that extent I support the report and the means of improving waste management contained in it
However I am not satisfied that due regard has been given to motorcycles
Motorcyclists if anything have been more environmentally friendly than those of us who travel on four wheels
There is a strong tradition of recycling motorcycle parts
I was therefore concerned when the original proposal was put forward that it appeared to ignore this tradition by putting two-wheeled vehicles in the same category as four-wheeled vehicles
My own view is that motorcycles as well as vintage cars should have been excluded from the legislation and that separate legislation should be drafted which would ensure compliance with genuine environmental concerns
End-of-life vehicles are a major environmental problem in the European Union
There are pollution problems associated with the types of waste that are separated from scrap vehicles during shredding but abandoned vehicles in particular are a major environmental problem in nature
It is therefore necessary to ensure that end-of-life vehicles are managed in a lawful and responsible way
Common EU rules in this area will help to reduce substantially pollution from hazardous substances
In addition end-of-life vehicle treatment undertakings can become more viable and generate more jobs
The proposed directive is therefore an immensely positive initiative
An appropriate means of preventing the use of certain hazardous substances in the manufacture of new cars is an important element in the proposed directive
However it is not realistic at the present time to introduce a total ban on certain substances which are necessary in small quantities in connection with certain alloys and rust-protection procedures
Moreover the demand for a horizontal directive providing for a total ban on PVC in the EU before is unrealistic and therefore cannot be given Conservative support in the European Parliament
Quisthoudt-Rowohl report A
Mr Antony tirade in this morning debate on research and development cooperation with Israel in which he accused Israel of producing ethnic weapons that would select their victims on the basis of race tell us more about Mr Antony views than Israel research policy
Only a racist could give credence to such nonsense
Only someone who believes the world is composed of sharply-defined races arranged in a neat hierarchy with them at the top of the food chain could imagine such a horror
It is not possible
There are more similarities in the genetic make-up between so-called races than between individuals within such races
Anyone who started such a programme would have already demonstrated they lack the scientific knowledge to carry it through
As I said this morning I will be voting to support this report with the few reservations I indicated then
Mr Antony views have only reinforced this decision
The State of Israel has laws which result in the persecution of and discrimination against its Palestinian neighbours
I support this agreement but would stress the need for the EU to draw attention to the way the State of Israel is showing scant respect for human rights and the ongoing peace process
Peace in the Middle East can be brought closer through cooperation with the West and technical development Sustainable peace however requires acknowledgement of every human being right to life together with compliance with the peace process that has been entered into
Kosovo
Our group did not co-sign the draft joint resolution on Kosovo
We believe that the text remains excessively one-sided containing too much simplistic and inflexible analysis a black and white approach left over from the cold war with its good guys and bad guys and a measure of inability to grasp properly the complex historical cultural and religious realities which a resurgence of Communist ideology has caused to resurface and which nevertheless now form the very heart of the problem on which an agreement is being sought
What our resolution should have done was to welcome the fact that firstly the advocates of a diplomatic solution have for the moment won out against the irresponsible hotheads and secondly that two European countries are playing a leading part for the European Union as a whole in the search for that solution
The Council clearly recognised that the best way to help achieve a diplomatic solution was not to use the complex and uncertain machinery of the CFSP but to lend resolute support to the work of the contact group made up of the powers inside and outside Europe which are best placed to play a decisive role in finding a way out of the crisis
The Rambouillet talks confirm the major role played in the contact group by the two European countries most heavily and specifically engaged in the search for a peaceful solution France and the United Kingdom the two European members of the UN Security Council
This House can only hope that the two European co-chairmen of the Rambouillet conference helped by the negotiators of the contact group will bring both their diplomatic skills and the utmost political determination to bear in persuading the protagonists in the fighting despite the absence of Milosevic which weakens the process to reach an agreement which will allow the question of Kosovo independence to be managed as peacefully as possible
Aldo report A
The document we are considering is what is called an own-initiative report in the European Parliament Such reports present the European Parliament point of view on issues directly or indirectly connected with the European Union some of which may not have been dealt with in Community legislation
This is therefore the European Parliament unilateral position and it does not have any immediate or concrete impact on the issues it relates to
Nevertheless the report does have the merit of drawing attention to real problems and that means it can initiate the legislative and decision-making process applying in the European Union as the Commission may implement some of the report highly positive recommendations for the ultraperipheral regions namely
The creation of a devolved Commission service in the ultraperipheral regions will help to physically strengthen the presence of the UPRs within the Community as a wholeEstablishment of enlarged regional markets for the exchange of products originating in the UPRs the overseas countries and territories and the ACP countries in the same geographical areaFacilitating the development of inter-regional exchanges with the focus on the areas of training and culture sea and air communications environmental protection and so onBut I do have one reservation about this report which is that it might open the door to interests alien to the ultraperipheral regions allowing them to misrepresent the specific nature and particular circumstances of what is meant by ultraperipheral which is already defined in Article of the Amsterdam Treaty
We unreservedly agree that it is vital to extend cultural and trade relations between the overseas countries and territories the ACP countries and the ultraperipheral regions of the European Union such as the Azores the Canary Islands and Madeira
But it is not enough to affirm that and institutionalise it by clarifying the position on the status of ultraperipheral regions as the new Treaty on European Union the Treaty of Amsterdam does in Article 
Policy guidelines and permanent means must be created to respond to specific needs and the proposed broadening of cultural and trade relations
We cannot accept the worrying tendency to view the UPRs in geo-strategic terms and exploit them accordingly involving quid pro quos or links with political and military blocs
Besides there is only one NATO which is celebrating its half-century not by seeking to make its own existence unnecessary but with every intention of carrying on
Banana exports
I pointed yesterday to the unacceptability of the retaliatory customs measures announced by the US against European products even before the WTO has looked at the new common organisation of the market in bananas
And this threat of sanctions has a definite effect because even before it is put into practice it is prompting the economic players to react
No WTO member has the right to take such measures unilaterally they must use the procedure for settling disputes laid down by the WTO
What do we see on the European side
Firstly we are seeing every day the very regrettable consequences of the European negotiators failure to secure adequate guarantees in the GATT agreements allowing us to preserve our preferential relations with the ACP countries Secondly we deplore the apparent willingness of certain European Member States to sacrifice European solidarity on condition that the US exempts them from its sanctions
Lastly the attitude of the German Presidency does not seem to be altogether unambiguous in that it has sought a direct settlement with the US without consulting its partners
We for our part wish to encourage the European Commission to show the utmost firmness which for once it seems intent on doing albeit very late in the day and consequently the Europe of Nations Group chose not to sign the compromise of the PPE and PSE Groups the content of which seemed to us insufficiently robust but proposed a more forceful compromise text instead together with four other political groups
We wished in particular to reaffirm in strong terms our support for our ACP partners to whom we are linked by an international agreement
We wished also to indicate Parliament fundamental disapproval of unilateral measures and deplore in no uncertain terms the USA declared intention to apply Section and super the spectre of which we were told had been banished for ever thanks to the Marrakesh agreements
In the absence of a European super we would also like to know how the Commission will react to safeguard our interests if the US should take the unilateral measures it has threatened
That concludes voting time
Statement by the President
At a meeting today the Conference of Presidents decided pursuant to Rule of the Rules of Procedure to bring forward the second March part-session to and March
The part-session will begin at pm on Monday March and will continue on Tuesday March
Voting time will be at oclock on Tuesday
The Conference of Presidents has decided to include in the agenda of Monday March a Commission statement followed by a debate on the action to be taken on the report of the Committee of Independent Experts
The deadline for tabling motions for resolutions will be Thursday March at pm
The deadline for tabling amendments and joint motions will be on Monday March at pm
The other items on the agenda will be decided by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting on March
It should be noted that it will be possible to hold a political group meeting on Wednesday March at pm and possibly on March at am as well as on Monday March before pm
Committee meetings already scheduled for and March will be postponed until and March
Further details will be provided by the committees involved
Mr President I am afraid I do not intend to respond to the remarks made by Mr Hänsch who was probably inspired by the Carnival in the Rhineland because he could not possibly have been inspired by the election results in Hesse No my intention is to raise the question of the Kazakhstan resolution again
Since making that point before I have received faulty copies from other Members and I now have this pile of faulty copies of the Kazakhstan resolution each comprising only straight lines
Following our earlier exchanges I checked at the desk outside this is no laughing matter gentlemen to see whether proper texts were available there
They do not have a single text that is properly printed
I do think we ought to take our parliamentary work seriously enough for me to be able to ask you to check what has happened here and for you to ensure that it does not happen again
We are going to check again but I have been assured that a fresh batch of properly printed resolutions were made available at the distribution desk
Mr President I would appreciate it if you could tell me whether or not the statement you have just read out has been printed and is being distributed in some way to Members
We have naturally taken note of it but there are too many changes to the calendar It would therefore be better if we received a written copy this evening perhaps in a fax to our offices
Mr President I should like to ask whether there will also be a vote in plenary on this change of date because as far as I am aware the original calendar of part-sessions was adopted by us here in the House If there is to be a vote when will it take place
I understand that the answer is No
The Conference of Presidents has the power to alter the date
I cannot answer detailed questions as I am no more informed about it than you are
Mr President I am interested in your announcement about the changing of the date of the mini-session
I am sure you are aware that visits are arranged for people from many parts of the world in the light of the timing of the mini-session
This change will certainly cause great difficulty as far as some of my visitors are concerned
Could you give me an explanation that I can pass on as to why the mini-session has been changed
I am sure there must be some very clear political reason but I did not quite understand what it was I did not quite hear what the explanation was
As I say I am learning as I go along
I am told it is because the original date clashed with the European Council meeting and we wish to meet before that meeting
Mr President just to give an explanation to Mr McGowan
The problem is that we have to hold a debate on the results of the Committee of Independent Experts in that mini-session
This has to happen in the presence of the Commission
But on the same date the Council is meeting in Berlin and it is impossible for the Commission to be in two places at the same time
Therefore the only solution was to find another date for the mini-session
As it is a sensitive issue we could not postpone it until the month of April
That is the real political explanation
Of course normally we would hold the mini-session on and March and the committee meetings would take place on and March
So this is reversed the mini-session will be on and March and the committee meetings on and March
That is the whole explanation
It is useful to have someone who attended the meeting to explain the situation
However the plenary is not the place to debate this
It was a decision taken by the Conference of Presidents
If you have a problem with it speak to your group leaders and raise the matter in your political groups
Combined transport dimensions and weights continuation
Mr President I hope that I can find my bearings again in the debate which we interrupted
The role of combined transport is to shift goods transport from the roads to the railways
It is capable of doing that despite its structural disadvantages thanks to the preferential measures designed to enable it to compete with the transport of goods by road
Nevertheless it has not developed to the extent that we transport policymakers had hoped and expected
The main reason is that the railways are taking a very long time to develop into modern service enterprises if they are developing in that direction at all
Combined transport is also the forerunner of a future model namely that of intermodal transport which will improve the flow of traffic for all types of carrier
A decisive breakthrough in the development of intermodal transport will naturally require a sea change in the political regulation of transport in Europe
What we are asking about today are the conditions under which the present superannuated form of combined transport can be sustained for long enough to develop into that model of the future without it grinding to a halt and simply being overrun by the road-transport juggernaut
The new proposal for a directive starts off in the right direction broadening the definition of combined transport to pave the way for intermodal transport
We are naturally calling for a precise limitation of the ratio of road legs to total mileage
The second step in the Commission proposal namely the European harmonisation of preferential measures also points in the right direction in my opinion
The issue of grants poses fewest problems
The maximum weight of tonnes and the exemptions from driving bans however remain bones of contention
I personally consider them necessary for a transitional period until a level playing field has been created for all modes of transport and intermodal transport has become an everyday phenomenon
I share some of my colleagues fears however firstly that the abuses which are already occurring today will become more widespread and secondly that the increase in exemptions from driving bans and derogations from weight limits could open the political floodgates for the extension of these privileges to road hauliers in general
For that reason we insist on follow-up negotiations to review the situation
Madam President both Parliament and the Commission agree that there is a need to actively promote combined transport by increasing the efficiency of the means of transferring transport of goods from road transport to more environmentally-friendly safer and more energy-efficient modes which are less prone to congestion
I welcome Parliament support for this approach
However I regret that the report before the House rejects two of the three main measures proposed by the Commission to promote combined transport and substantially amends the other
The suggestions set out in the report would not achieve what both of our institutions and the majority of Member States want and that is the further development of combined transport as an efficient and viable alternative to current dependence on road transport
Therefore it would be useful to pursue discussions on this text at a later stage to allow us to take Council view on this proposal into account
Meanwhile on Mr Wijsenbeek amendment it is generally acceptable since it developed some of the ideas in our proposal while remaining faithful to the existing directive
But I am aware that Mr Wijsenbeek colleagues on the Committee on Transport and Tourism do not share his views
Let me briefly comment on two of the three components of the proposal exemptions from driving bans and derogations from weight limits
The Commission proposed Community-wide exemptions of the road legs of combined transport from restrictions on driving at weekends during the night holiday periods and during periods of high pollution
Such exemptions would improve the competitiveness of combined transport by comparison with road transport and would ensure greater reliability and regularity of combined transport services without jeopardising social and environmental standards
Obviously combined transport would have a major advantage if clients could have their goods moved and delivered when unimodal road haulage was forbidden
At present there are about lorry bans in existence in the Community with many detailed exceptions to them for combined transport services
That needs serious improvement because combined transport obviously involves several links and if one is not allowed for example on Sunday night the whole chain is jeopardised
If a ban ends at pm there just is not time after the trucks have reached the terminal to form a rail train that would allow arrival the next morning
That means all transport operation starting at pm would go totally by road and in international road container traffic that means average driving distances of about kms
Is it really safer or more socially acceptable or more efficient to do that than to have a road journey of about kms to or from a rail terminal on a Sunday
The environmental congestion social and efficiency arguments all point in one direction
Secondly we believe that transport operators should have the option of using a maximum authorised vehicle weight of tonnes for road transport when it is specifically used as part of a combined transport operation involving the movement by different transport units in the whole Community
That is not just a marginal incentive
It may lower costs by % and is of course only applicable over the shorter road legs of the combined transport journey
It is an efficient way of making combined transport more attractive
For these reasons I am at this stage only in a position to accept two technical amendments in addition to Mr Wijsenbeek ones Nos and and I have to reject the other ones
It would be most productive to revisit this issue at a later date against the background of the Council common position and after detailed discussion of the arguments
I hope we could then take a joint view about how a satisfactory compromise could be developed so that we could fulfil our common objective of supporting combined transport
Thank you Commissioner
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at am
Article a of th ACP-EC Convention
The next item is the recommendation A by Mrs Aelvoet on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation on the draft Council Decision on the framework procedure for implementing Article a of the fourth ACP-EC Convention CAVC
Madam President ladies and gentlemen about two years ago the Council consulted the European Parliament about the procedure for implementing Article a of the Fourth ACP-EC Convention which deals with how the European Union reacts to serious human rights abuses or the total failure of democratisation processes and so on as a result of which the Union may suspend cooperation with the country concerned
The whole issue has been dragging on for two years now because of a fundamental disagreement between Parliament and the Council about the role that Parliament should be allowed to play in this process
Originally it was the view of the vast majority in fact nearly all Members of this House that we wanted the assent procedure to be applied but this was rejected out of hand
We then decided to go for the consultation procedure
In connection with this I had informal contacts not really enough to merit the term negotiations with the UK Presidency on behalf of the Council but these proved fruitless
The issue was raised again during the Austrian Presidency which then ensured that the Council was formally consulted to see whether it would agree to the consultation procedure
The result was that only two of the fifteen Member States were prepared to agree to Parliament request
So once again we came back empty-handed
Since then the Council has made a small change to the text of the proposal which had originally called for a qualified majority for any decision to be taken in this context
The qualified majority still stands but unanimity is now required in the case of full suspension of the application of the Convention
It is important to note that up to now this has never actually happened even in very difficult situations such as with Nigeria a few years ago
It was always the case that a number of articles were suspended but never the entire Convention
The situation today is as follows
If Parliament decides to refuse to give its assent then in any event as soon as the Amsterdam Treaty comes into force and that is not so far off now all that is required under the provisions of the Treaty is that we should be informed
That is the only right we have in this context
So there is little point in obstinately refusing to give our assent here in Parliament given that this will only result in the unanimity rule applying for the remaining months if cooperation is to be suspended
This is certainly not likely to promote rapid and appropriate action by the Union in cases of serious human rights violations
So because we would much prefer rapid action to be taken where possible by a qualified majority I did not think I would be justified in calling for us to stick to our guns and refuse to give assent to the Council draft decision
Against my will therefore but in consideration of the practical consequences I therefore recommend that we accept the decision as it stands knowing that we have one small consolation which is that whenever such a measure is to be taken the Commission will inform Parliament at the same time as the Council so that Parliament can react in good time
I have to say that it is thanks to our particularly close cooperation with the Commission on this document that we are able to relinquish the genuine consultation that we should have had with rather less distress than would otherwise have been the case
Madam President we have already debated the implementation of Article a of the Fourth Lomé Convention on many other occasions
It lays down the procedure for suspending cooperation with countries in violation of the essential provisions of Article 
This was one of the principal innovations of the Fourth Lomé Convention and it makes cooperation dependent on respect for human rights democracy and the principles of good governance
I also want to thank Mrs Aelvoet on behalf of the Socialist Group
Under her wise guidance as rapporteur the European Parliament tried to democratise the procedures the Commission proposed by making Parliament opinion compulsory through the assent procedure
But the Council intransigence plus the objective legal restrictions of the Lomé Convention made it necessary to move towards a compromise
As the rapporteur says all things considered the result is better than nothing
The decision in the Council is no longer required to be unanimous but is to be by a qualified majority and the Commission undertakes to inform Parliament in good time of any major change in the implementation of the suspension procedure
Parliament will obviously be extremely vigilant and insistent about this
It is effectively better than nothing so our group will vote in favour of the draft decision as recommended by the rapporteur
Madam President as always Mrs Aelvoet has produced an excellent report on a very delicate subject
However it is a sad indictment of the world we live in that Article a has to be written into the fourth ACP-EU Convention at all
Having just returned from Africa yesterday and hearing of the latest events in Zimbabwe it is vital the Commission has the power of suspension and is able to act quickly
Of course it would be good practice if Parliament and by that I assume the Committee on Development and Cooperation could be consulted before suspension took place
But I have to be honest and say that we live in the real world
There will be occasions when the Commission has to act quickly to convey the message to any nation abusing human rights before it has the opportunity to ask Parliament
The key to the report is the sentence that the Commission wherever possible will inform Parliament in advance of any suspension or indeed resumption of cooperation
I believe that is a fair compromise between the Commission and Parliament and therefore support the proposal that Parliament give its assent to the draft Council decision
However there is an interesting situation which will arise after the year under the new Lomé Agreement whatever that may be
As the Commission will know the proposals for any new ACP-EU agreement could be based on regional cooperation and integration with funding being distributed via the regional organisations rather than through individual nations and national indicative programmes
I wonder how Article a can operate in such circumstances as the Commission will have lost the ability to sanction an individual nation within a region
It would be unfair to sanction the entire region
Perhaps Commissioner Brittan could pass on that particular question to the appropriate Commission service for an answer at a later date
As there are a number of difficult situations building up in various African states I hope the Commission will use Article a in its widest form
Human rights to me should include pluralism good governance an independent judiciary a free press as well as free and fair elections
My group will be supporting this report
Once again I congratulate Mrs Aelvoet on the work she has done on behalf of this Parliament
Madam President the Liberal Group has always called for transparency in our human rights policy
Procedures must be clear
Article of the Lomé Convention makes human rights policy an essential element of cooperation and Article a which we are discussing now deals with the procedures surrounding the suspension of cooperation with the Lomé countries
The fact that such an operational article exists is an advantage but the procedures themselves should have been better
The rapporteur has done her best to ensure that Parliament has a say and that majority decisions apply in the Council
The Liberals have always taken the view that Parliament assent should be needed for Lomé cooperation to be suspended
After all Parliament assent was needed for the Lomé Convention to come into force
The fact that we are now simply to be informed by the Commission if cooperation is to be suspended is not enough but as a pragmatist I realise that we could not have obtained more
After all the interinstitutional discussions since the Commission proposal of February the procedure finally needs to be wound up and we must put this new instrument to good use in our human rights policy as quickly as possible
Finally I should like to thank and congratulate Mrs Aelvoet for this recommendation but she does not need to be told that
I should like to thank and congratulate Mrs Aelvoet for all the work that she has done to make it possible for Parliament to give its consent and for the realistic and reasonable approach that she has shown as have other speakers such as Mr Corrie and Mr Vecchi
I would like to reiterate what we stressed when the interim report was discussed here last June namely that we intend to keep Parliament fully informed of any initiative which we might take or any proposal which we might submit to the Council with regard to the implementation of Article a of the Fourth Lomé Convention which sadly as has been said is not something that can be regarded as a purely theoretical possibility
I would add that in the only case so far in which Article a was invoked against Togo the Commission immediately informed Parliament of its intentions as the rapporteur has acknowledged in her report for which I thank her
We will continue as ever to take very seriously any opinions or resolutions adopted by Parliament which might affect implementation of the consultation and suspension procedure laid down in Article a
With regard to Mr Corrie query about how it would work in a situation where the regional element is to the fore I will certainly convey that query to those who are handling this matter on a day-to-day basis
The Commission is pleased that with Parliament assent the framework decision will take effect giving us a proper and transparent procedure for taking appropriate measures if essential provisions of the revised Fourth Lomé Convention are violated
Thank you Commissioner

Macro-financial assistance to Albania
The next item is the report A by Mrs van Bladel on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations on the proposal for a Council Decision providing macrofinancial assistance to Albania CCNS
Madam President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen in this debate on the granting of EUR million in macro-financial assistance to Albania I think it is extremely important to look at the political and economic context in which the assistance is being provided
Let me pick out a few points
Albania freed itself from Marxist dictatorship much later than other countries in the eastern bloc and this means that the problems of developing a pluralist society are persisting for longer than in any of the other countries where some progress has been made
The economic and social conditions are such that in my view Albania can rightly be described as a third world country on the Union doorstep
The collapse of the pyramid schemes the plundering of the munitions depots which we all remember very clearly a Kalashnikov now has a street value of five to ten dollars the effects of the conflict in neighbouring Kosovo all of these things have led to the enormous tide of refugees who are now on the move with economic refugees coming to the Union and political refugees fleeing Kosovo for Albania
In short Albania does not just have serious internal problems to resolve
Because of its geographical situation it cannot escape being politically influenced by surrounding countries in the Balkans
Mr Imbeni made this point very clearly during the Kosovo debate yesterday
However there are some glimmers of hope
Last November a new constitution was approved with a % turnout and a new leader Mr Majko seems to be making good progress towards guaranteeing independent roles for the president the legislature and the judiciary
However Albania political recovery is closely linked to the priorities to be met for economic recovery
Last October the Albanian authorities in Tirana assured the group of donors that they will promote the development of an action plan to combat corruption and introduce legislation to create the climate needed to encourage investment which is currently at a very low level there is almost no investment from outside the country so that investors will also have a better guarantee of getting their money back in future
It is also important here to monitor whether the new Customs Code does indeed consolidate customs and tax revenue collection and then the main concern is the further winding-up of the pyramid selling companies though it is still not known whether Albanians will ever see any of their money again
Unfortunately we can do nothing to ensure that they do
Since the European Union has been the largest donor to Albania and in view of the country economic and financial situation international aid is still desperately needed if only to keep the current account going
This is why it is vital that we should flesh out the ECOFIN Council decision of last April as quickly as possible
The Commission is in an excellent position to do this with its considerable experience of Albania
Up to now we have mainly provided donations but this time it is a loan
However in my view we must prevent Albania from falling into the disastrous vicious circle of being financially dependent on outside help
For this reason in the extremely successful cooperation which I had with Mr Brinkhorst from the Committee on Budgets for which I would like to thank him unfortunately he could not be here this evening I proposed that a coherent assessment should be made of the direction and state of progress of the political and institutional reforms in Albania
I have therefore asked the Commission not just to rely on the technical evaluations of international financial bodies such as the IMF but to involve the Committee on Monetary Affairs and the PHARE committee in its assessment
The aim is for Parliament to have a comprehensive picture of the reforms before the second tranche is paid
The intention is not to put Albania under the microscope but to promote sound and efficient management
In my opinion this is not just what EU citizens want it is what Albanian citizens want as well
I should like to thank the members of the Committee on External Economic Relations for their critical yet supportive views and I hope that tomorrow the House will accept the amendments which are before us because almost a year has already passed between the ECOFIN decision and the start of implementation and Albania is simply raring to go
Madam President we know that Albania is still facing many intractable problems especially problems in connection with internal security and public order which are affecting all other areas
Nevertheless in the midst of all these problems relatively speaking I am amazed at the success this small country has had in implementing the six-month contingency programme from October to March which allowed it to tackle the social crisis and the civil war in the spring of 
We therefore have initial proof at least that by following a specific programme in a well-disciplined manner and with adequate technical support the Albanian Government can be effective and make progress
However as was clear from the serious regression which took place in September last year the problems of Albania centre more around the lack of communication and dialogue among the country political powers and their inability to reach agreement on a minimum joint programme to extricate the country once and for all from the crisis it is in rather than on the genuinely deep economic recession
The European Union and international organisations must give generously all the help they possibly can to enable this country to find positive solutions to its problems
Albania is part of Europe it has contributed to the history of Europe and from this standpoint it is a potential applicant country for the European Union
It must nevertheless be made clear to all the political powers in Albania that responsibility for the progress and future prospects of the country lie fairly and squarely with them
The European Union is granting macro-financial aid to support the efforts made by Albania but this must in no way be taken as a shifting of responsibilities
The Albanian Government must intensify its own efforts to solve its problems and it must push forward policies and economic reforms to ensure that democratic institutions run smoothly and that the rule of law operates correctly
The adoption of the constitution was of course a major step in the right direction
However we must have guarantees that human rights will be respected that there will be a smooth transition to a market economy financial stability and above all a revitalisation of the credit system
Corruption must be stamped out and organised crime combated Structures and procedures must be created to guarantee transparency and to ensure that public money is handled honestly
Only in this way can a climate of security be created for investment
The EUR million are rather less than what the Albanian Government had hoped for and more importantly less than what the country needs to tackle its problems
Nevertheless strengthening the credibility of the country and ensuring economic and political stability will gradually increase its ability to take on loans and above all will attract foreign investments which Albania desperately needs
We all know that my country Greece sincerely hopes that progress will be made and it supports in every way the attempts of the Albanian Government to carry forward the necessary policies and institutional reforms which will bring Albania closer to the European model
Madam President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I should like to begin by thanking Mrs van Bladel for her excellent report
It has our full support
As she said and as my honourable colleague Mrs Karamanou has just stated Albania is not only one of the weakest countries in economic terms it is also lagging far behind the other countries in the development of democratic structures
Its situation is similar to that of Bosnia-Herzegovina in other words Albania has to be financially drip-fed by the European Union
We not only provide food aid
We not only provide general reconstruction aid
The European Union also spends money on the refugees from Kosovo who have found a temporary abode in Albania
But the crucial point and this is where we start to see the light is that the last government reshuffle and the adoption of a constitution in Albania have laid the foundation stone for the construction of a stable system of government
It is important to us of course to have a partner in whom we can have at least a reasonable degree of trust and whom we can provide with the necessary funds to develop the structures of government and to ensure that the police and the armed forces return to their role as servants of the democratic order instead of being a law unto themselves with all the problems which that has entailed in Albania over the past two to three years
It is also crucial that Albania should gradually win over the confidence of the international financial system and of investors that Albania should thereby become an interesting location for prospective investors in the long run and that at the same time the conditions should be created in which welfare capitalism can flourish
We have come a long way
What we must do is to make sure that the control which is now required can also be extended to cover macrofinancial aid to a certain degree
The very idea of macrofinancial aid of course is that it is not designed to fund specific projects but to provide the state with a pool of funds with which it can perform and develop the tasks of government
But I nevertheless consider it important that we strike a good balance between trust and verification a balance that will also encourage the Albanians the Albanian Government to progress along the right path
I have the impression that this financial aid of ours represents a small mosaic tile that Albania needs in order to go on constructing a stable future and I hope that we shall soon see appropriate verification measures from the Commission to help ensure that this goal is achieved
Madam President my comments on the report and the rapporteur amendments are very brief
Our group supports them in their entirety
As regards the aid although we feel this should be granted under the most favourable conditions possible for the time being there must also of course be a number of conditions attached as both the Commission and the rapporteur propose
Let me just mention one of these
We think that it is high time that the investigation into the pyramid selling schemes was completed the capital collected should be paid out to the creditors and legislation should be introduced to combat money laundering
The schemes demonstrate the need for better financial controls on all sorts of institutions including banks
That said the greatest risk still remains as the rapporteur pointed out that one hand will be paying out what the other receives in other words that one loan will be applied for in order to pay another loan off
This would be a disastrous development for a country that does not need one loan after another but productive investment including from the European Union so that it can generate its own independent economic development
This is what Albania needs in the long run
Madam President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen we must compliment Mrs van Bladel on her report
Obviously the European Union has made a good many mistakes over Albania and this EUR million loan will not fundamentally change the situation
That said this loan will be something of a shot in the arm for Mr Majko who is making heroic efforts but has very little room for manoeuvre
It is the European Union general attitude on Albania which is wrong
We are witnessing the growth of criminal activity encouraged ultimately by the European Union
The Union should be far bolder in its policy
We should do what to some extent our Greek friends are doing but not other countries starting with Italy and set very generous immigration quotas in order to break the power of mafia groups which feed on the traffic in labour and other commodities such as drugs
We should generously open our universities and give thousands of study grants to Albanian students
Measures are needed to block the rise of opposition to the legal authorities in Albania to prevent pyramid selling operations and situations of general political instability notwithstanding the good intentions and intelligence of the current Albanian leadership
In the absence of such measures Albania will mark time for a good many years to come
I therefore call on the Vice-President of the Commission in particular and the Commission in general to urge the Member States not to regularise the situation after the event as has been done now in Italy where people have been legalised as immigrants because in the meantime the emigration mafia have netted their profits
We should act ahead of the event and set quotas in all countries of the European Union
I think that if the burden were spread over the Union as a whole it would not be too severe and this is what we need to do to tackle the root of the problem
Madam President I should also like to begin of course by expressing my sincere thanks to the rapporteur who in my opinion has truly produced a very very good piece of work
I believe that when we speak of Albania we must not forget that it is a country which has had to make an unimaginably huge leap forward within a few years and still has an enormous amount of ground to make up
During the Enver Hoxha era the country was virtually dragged back into the Stone Age and now it needs to progress by leaps and bounds at a time when the entire surrounding region is far from stable
I believe our aid can only be a drop in the ocean but it may serve a useful purpose inside the country helping to overcome the barriers that exist there
We must remember that Albania is divided into two large areas the north and the south with the Gegs and the Tosks respectively traditional enemies who naturally continued to wage war during the Stone Age into which Enver Hoxha led the country and that many of the conflicts we see today have their roots in that antithesis
It is even reflected in the party structure we find in Albania today
The new Albanian constitution has naturally raised high hopes
I very much hope that it will be possible to give the opposition a suitably constructive role to play in the Albanian political system because I believe it has adopted very constructive positions in many areas
Only then will it be possible for Albania to bring the problems with its neighbours under some sort of control
Naturally and this has been emphasised several times this evening it will be necessary to introduce appropriate verification mechanisms
Only if these mechanisms exist particularly in relation to the Albanian democratisation process will the aid from the European Union be able to achieve anything
Many other verification measures have been mentioned especially the mechanisms designed to curb the corruption the arms trade and the drug trafficking that exist in Albania
We cannot achieve complete control in these areas we can only do a little here to help the Albanians to help themselves but we should do whatever we can
In that respect Mrs van Bladel report and the efficient aid that should result from it represent a step in the right direction
Thank you Commissioner
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at am
The sitting was closed at pm
Approval of the Minutes
The Minutes of yesterday sitting have been distributed
Are there any comments
Madam President the work which we have carried out this week could not have been done without the help of interpreters
It has come to my knowledge that we have freelance interpreters whom the Commission has not paid properly since October
This week the Commission published a document on how it is going to improve things in the administration
We have interpreters who have been without proper pay and who are experiencing some financial difficulties
Could Commissioner Bangemann take this back to his colleagues and would President Santer when he has some time away from meeting farmers arrange to meet the interpreters who work for us and settle this problem
We take note of that Mr McMahon but at the moment we are dealing with the approval of the Minutes
I would ask that only Members who wish to speak on the Minutes should ask for the floor now
If you have a point of order please say under which Rule you wish to raise it
Madam President I would just like to reiterate something that was said yesterday in the minutes about the large number of roll-call votes
We have pages of roll-call votes and it seems that the smaller the group the more roll-call votes it wants
I defy anybody to tell me whether there is one citizen anywhere in the European Union who wants to know how David Hallam voted on the second part of Amendment of the Florenz Report
It is a ridiculous situation and a waste of money and should be brought to an end
That point was raised yesterday Mr Hallam
We take note of your comment
Madam President it is recorded in the Minutes that I raised an objection yesterday to the effect that we did not have a correct German text of the Kazakhstan resolution
My objection was not about the lack of a correct text but rather the lack of any text at all
Lines drawn below the heading Kazakhstan and crosses and dots can scarcely be called an incorrect text quite simply there was no text
That is why I must insist on asking for a check to be carried out to ascertain why such a document was distributed
The reason why some Members mistakenly thought that the proper text was available is that copies of the text were produced for a meeting of the group leaders yesterday morning but by yesterday evening the distribution desk only had this version with the lines and crosses
The point I am making is that all Members of the House must receive printed texts and not only individual representatives of the groups otherwise we might as well abolish the Chamber and conduct all our business in the Conference of Presidents
I can understand your dissatisfaction Mr Posselt
The matter has been looked into and it appears that there was indeed a version such as you have described although there was the other version too
We shall investigate why the proper text was not the only one to be distributed
At least the rest of the House did have the correct version
But we shall look into how it was possible for this to happen
Madam President it grieves me to have to agree with Mr Hallam but the point I would like to make also concerns the number of roll-call votes which was discussed yesterday
What concerns me is not the actual number of votes I know this is already in hand but rather why every single Member has to be presented with this weighty tome when far fewer copies could be produced for those sad Members who actually wish to go through and check how they voted
Alternatively it could be available on the Internet which would save an awful lot of money
Likewise with the huge book of minutes
I am sure it is very important but there are large numbers of Members who have already departed from Strasbourg but are still getting a copy of this in their pigeonholes
It represents a vast expense of time and effort and could be made available just to those Members who want it or drawn down off the Internet when people wish to refer to specific items
Ladies and gentlemen I can understand your agitation but the Rules of Procedure provide for this to happen
If you wish to change this you have the opportunity of submitting amendments to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure
Every Member is entitled to do that
Madam President concerning pages and of the Minutes in the French version the president of the sitting Mr Martin I think it was reported that the Conference of Presidents had decided to bring forward the Brussels mini-session from and March to and March
I should like to repeat here what I said at the Conference of Presidents on behalf of my group
We find this decision neither opportune nor legally correct
It is not opportune because the calendar was set long ago was adopted by the plenary and this change has not been put to the House
I am not sure that it is really the place of the Conference of Presidents to change the calendar which has been agreed
The fact that the summit is scheduled for and March in Berlin is no reason to bring the part-session forward and make us decide our position at all costs in advance of that summit
And legally speaking I am surprised that the Committee on Budgetary Control one of Parliament committees should have been sidestepped in this matter
The report we asked for from the committee of experts is part of the consequences of our withholding the discharge for 
It runs parallel to the procedure normally followed here
The Committee on Budgetary Control under the annex to the Rules of Procedure which lays down the powers and responsibilities of the committees has sole responsibility for all questions concerning the implementation of budgets and all questions concerning the financial management of the Commission
It thus has responsibility for giving an opinion under paragraph of the annex in question for giving its opinion to Parliament before the House decides its position
The group of experts does not have to put itself in the hands of the political groups It must first put itself in the hands of the appropriate members of the Committee on Budgetary Control
That is why I regard this decision as neither opportune nor legally sound
Applause
Ladies and gentlemen I know there is dissatisfaction but I should like to explain the legal situation to you once again
According to Rule in Chapter II of the Rules of Procedure which deals with the sessions of Parliament Parliament shall itself determine the duration of adjournments of the session
This therefore means that we decide once a year on the dates of our sittings for the year ahead
In addition Rule states that the Conference of Presidents stating its reasons may alter the duration of adjournments decided pursuant to paragraph at least two weeks before the date previously fixed by Parliament for resuming the session the date of resumption shall not however be postponed for more than two weeks
Now Mr Fabre-Aubrespy is saying that he opposed this in the Conference of Presidents
However it was announced to us and most of the chairmen of the political groups are present here that this was in fact the decision taken by the group chairmen in that body
In legal terms that is perfectly in order even if you are expressing your dissatisfaction at what was decided
The reasons are as follows only a few Members were present yesterday and Mrs Aelvoet made the same point and she is also a member of the Conference of Presidents the Conference of Presidents decided to bring forward the part-session in Brussels to Monday and Tuesday March to enable Parliament to express its views on the report by the Committee of Independent Experts before the European Council meeting on and March and in the presence of the President of the Commission
That is quite clear and we do not need to discuss it any further
The decision has been taken
If you are unhappy please take the matter up with your group chairmen
There is no point in discussing it any further now since the legal situation is quite clear
Madam President you were kind enough to announce that Mr Posselt legitimate objection will be examined
May I ask another favour of you would you please inform the House what will happen if it transpires that Parliament really did vote on a series of lines and dots
Madam President this morning I bought a postcard of the new European Parliament building the new Hemicycle that is being built but
I am sorry to interrupt you Mr Vallvé but we are still dealing with the approval of the Minutes
It says on this postcard that the new building is the new hemicycle the new plenary chamber for the Council of Europe
Did we really erect this building I wonder for the Council of Europe
Madam President during the last two part-sessions of this Parliament we have sat in this Chamber and voted on hundreds of amendments in various different reports
Many of those reports have then been sent back to committee
Is it not about time that we looked at the Rules of Procedure and tried to decide that if any report comes forward with a certain number of amendments to it it goes straight back to committee without wasting the time of this House
We would then have more time to get on with debates which is what we should be doing as Members of Parliament
Let me repeat if any Member feels that the Rules of Procedure need to be changed and incidentally there will be a debate on this subject in March then they should simply take the necessary measures
Each and every Member is entitled to propose amendments to the Rules of Procedure
There is no point in just calling for these changes and then not following this up with any action
If you think that things are not being done in an appropriate way then you can submit your proposals
Madam President you rightly said and substantiated it by reference to the Rules of Procedure that the part-session dates are laid down and can be changed again within a certain time-limit
I do not question that
Nevertheless I should like to remind everyone that the report by this committee of wise men has been produced in response to the whole question of how we should deal with the discharge for 
To that extent it is only right that the committee responsible namely the Committee on Budgetary Control should be able to deliver its opinion on the issue
Applause
If we did that through resolutions by the political groups that might be a solution but at the end of the day this report is floating in thin air somewhere in the sense that it is not in any way incorporated into our parliamentary work
I wish to point out that we should initiate a proper procedure here to avoid the possibility of the report falling victim to political discrepancies and thereby failing to shed any light on the issue in which case Parliament could do nothing with it
That is why I insist that this report by the wise men be dealt with in the Committee on Budgetary Control
Applause
Thank you Mrs Theato
Your comments will be passed on and recorded in the Minutes
They will be dealt with by the appropriate body
Madam President may we therefore assume that the committee meetings which would have been held on the nd and rd have now been postponed until the th and th
That is indeed the case
However you will be informed of that again in writing
Madam President still on the subject of the Minutes may I say that you quoted the Rule correctly but that Rule in Chapter II also has a fifth paragraph which states that exceptionally after consulting the Conference of Presidents the President shall convene Parliament at the request of a majority of its Members or at the request of the Commission or the Council
So this means that provided a majority of Members so wish we can indeed discuss these dates
That is correct Mr Rübig but at the moment no such request has been submitted
Madam President ladies and gentlemen it was essential to find another date for the mini-session because otherwise the Commission would have had to be in two places at once with us in Brussels to hear Parliament assessment of the report of the committee of wise men and in Berlin discussing Agenda with the Council
That was not possible
So we agreed at the Conference of Presidents I did my group did that the mini-session should be brought forward
That is one part of the story
The second part of the story is the question of why this is being discussed here in the plenary
I maintained that this should be dealt with through the Committee on Budgetary Control
But I was in a minority as other people were too
So if the House thinks it would be better done through the Committee on Budgetary Control as I do we should plan to hold a vote on it and we can easily do that at the March part-session here in Strasbourg because that will be coming up first
So I propose that we schedule a vote on this for the March part-session and then it will be over and done with
Thank you Mrs Aelvoet
Since some of the members of the Conference of Presidents are also present that will no doubt be discussed again
Madam President I had not intended to intervene but some of the questions that have been raised here and in the debate are based perhaps on a certain misunderstanding
Mrs Aelvoet has dealt with the issue of the date
There was a preference in the Conference of Presidents to bring the date of the plenary session forward
That was for a number of good reasons
We wanted to have present at our debate President Santer from the Commission
If the House insists on maintaining the original date President Santer will instead be at a European Council meeting
It would not make sense for us to have a debate without the President of the Commission
A second point on the timing this Committee of Experts will make its report available if I recall correctly on March
In my view the Conference of Presidents rightly considers that this House should express a political view on that matter at an early date
We should not have a report on which everyone in Europe has their say but the people who commissioned the report are not players in the field
That too means we should come forward earlier and not later
The Committee of Experts was established as you will see if you read the terms of reference and the original vote in this House under the auspices of Parliament not one of its committees
In the first instance Parliament will then need to have the work of that committee returned to it and express political conclusions in a debate in the House
At the Conference of Presidents it was also said acknowledged and understood that in the normal course of events apart from that political debate the substance and conclusions of the work of the experts will revert to the Committee on Budgetary Control
The Conference of Presidents assumes that the committee will then wish to incorporate any of the relevant observations and conclusions into its proper ordinary work which serves this House so well
So we should not have a debate based on misunderstanding
No-one is highjacking the work of the committee
The House set up a group which reports to the House and we have a general political debate
But within the House there is a committee responsible for incorporating the substantive work
Nothing was done at the Conference of Presidents to undermine diminish or set to one side the substantive or procedural work of the Committee on Budgetary Control
If that was the case I would have objected
It was not the case and hence I did not object
Madam President Rule deals with the duties of the Conference of Presidents
It is high time the chairmen of the groups Mrs Aelvoet especially grasped the fact that our calendar of part-sessions is set by the plenary a year in advance
If the dates of meetings of the Council of Ministers then clash with those of our part-sessions it is the Commission duty since it is the Commission which is under scrutiny here to be with Parliament and not the ministers
Mr Wijsenbeek the Rules also say that in an exceptional case the reasons must be stated and that has been done
Madam President ladies and gentlemen I am disinclined to contribute to this debate
I feel a little bewildered
Various group leaders are each giving their version
What we need is an accurate account of what was decided yesterday at the Conference of Presidents
Parliament needs to be informed in the case of sensitive procedures like these
That seems to me the right way to do things
The wrong way is to have each member of the Conference of Presidents standing up here and giving his version of what was decided
I am in favour of this decision and I shall vote for it
There was no majority in favour of some of my views but I think that if Parliament is to function properly we must have decisions reported here properly by the President of Parliament for example
Madam President as Mr Wijsenbeek says the Council manifestly takes no account of Parliament calendar since it sets dates which clash with ones we ourselves earmarked over a year ago
But I think we should have held the debate yesterday evening when the announcement was made and when there were still enough people in the Chamber to hold a vote if necessary
Personally I suggest quite simply that we get on with our work this morning and proceed with the votes
My colleague Mr Martin was in the Chair yesterday and announced the facts of the matter to the House
The sitting then continued as usual without any debate
I would assume that most Members were at first somewhat taken aback and needed to reflect on the situation
However it must also be possible for such a topic to be discussed outside the normal schedule since that is in all Members interest
Madam President I simply want to express my absolute agreement with the comments made by Mr Cox not just as regards the outcome of the decisions which he expressed but the reasons which guided the decisions that were made yesterday in the Conference of Presidents
He was absolutely correct
Madam President ladies and gentlemen it has clearly emerged during our discussion here that this is an impossible state of affairs
Just because the ladies and gentlemen who head our states and governments all gentlemen as it so happens are to gather for a meeting they take it for granted that this Parliament will alter its schedule to accommodate them
That is unacceptable
Applause
Just imagine that a national government and as a German I am naturally aware that my country is currently presiding over the Council but that is not my point the identity of the government is irrelevant decided to hold a cabinet meeting and expected the national parliament to alter its schedule
That would be an intolerable state of affairs which is why I say that the European Parliament should not take this lying down
Applause
Madam President these dates were set by the former German Government I thought Mr Poettering would like to know that
There would seem to be no further comments on the Minutes
The Minutes were approved
VOTES
This House has spoken out on more than one occasion in favour of a mode of transport which is kind to the environment
How could we fail to welcome this opinion
The European Commission is endeavouring to develop combined transport as far as possible as an alternative to road transport
This solution is endorsed by transport operators and likewise by the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism
But this time as part of its moves to encourage the development of combined transport the European Commission is putting a controversial measure to us namely the lifting of restrictions on weekend and night driving for movements of road freight which are one leg of a combined transport operation
We cannot agree to this proposal Its aim would be purely and simply to get round national prohibitions
Moreover it is for each Member State to enact such prohibitions according to the principle of subsidiarity
There are other ways of promoting combined transport and I am thinking in particular of the PACT programme
We should use and expand existing initiatives before introducing measures which are unpopular and which often do not produce the right effect
van Bladel report A
It is a good thing to be giving macro-financial assistance to Albania
Events in Kosovo are having a major economic and social impact on that country
Various international embargos including that of the European Union are a partial factor too
So we cannot deny them macro-financial aid
For these reasons I voted in favour of the Commission proposal
I did not however vote for Amendments Nos and to the van Bladel report
These amendments make the provision of aid contingent on political criteria which are far too demanding
Of course a healthy political climate is necessary for economic progress
But you could equally well put it the other way round
We have taken on political obligations which we cannot evade even if the political situation in Albania is other than we would wish
My second reservation concerns the breadth of the criteria
To my mind a good customs code is not a sensible criterion for granting aid
These reservations do not mean that I think aid should be given with no strings attached
The European Union has a clear policy here
There is the human rights clause for example
For individual countries general criteria provide the guideline for decisions on whether or not aid should be given
EAGGF recovery of claims
The next item is the report A by Mr Bardong on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund and of agricultural levies and customs duties and in respect of value-added tax and certain excise duties CCOD
Madam President ladies and gentlemen the directive we are debating today and on which we shall be voting relates to mutual assistance between Member States in the recovery of tax debts
There is certainly a great deal of scope for such assistance
Member States can even enforce judgments in these matters
The proper functioning of the single market depends in part on the effectiveness of this mutual support
That sadly is far from being the case at the present time
Nevertheless since the annual number of recovery requests has averaged about the total sum claimed amounting to ECU million
This enforced payment of tax debts always becomes particularly difficult for both parties when the debtors have deposited all or part of their assets in another Member State to protect them from seizure
The result is that only % to % of such debts are actually recovered
Directives which were adopted back in and contained provisions designed to deal with this problem not only for agricultural levies but also for customs duties and subsequently for VAT and excise duty too
In the Commission made an additional proposal but it was voted down
It is now proposing new amendments to improve and modernise this procedure because some aspects of it are no longer in tune with present-day requirements
The crux of the matter to which I shall restrict my remarks consists of three points
Firstly taxes on income and property are brought into the scope of the directive
This may come as a surprise to many people because it is not even mentioned in the title
In Article of the amended directive however it is explicitly stated
We welcome that and surely cannot do otherwise but I wonder why the Commission did not deal with this more clearly and why this aspect of the directive is not really apparent from the title
Secondly when one state asks another to recover tax debts for it the requested state must take the same trouble that it takes to collect its own taxes
Thirdly executory titles transmitted by a requesting state are to become directly enforceable in the requested state
This means that there should be no more of the delays that have hitherto resulted from the need for official recognition of the titles sometimes entailing an additional authorisation process
Executory titles will therefore be directly enforceable even in the other state in which the debtor is being pursued and no requested state may insist on implementing its own validation procedure
We believe that the Commission proposal is right in principle and is necessary if the single market is to function properly
In our view however it does not go far enough in some points to provide the basis for really decisive improvements
For that reason the Committee on Budgetary Control is proposing a number of further amendments
First of all to combat fraud and tax evasion more effectively we need to guarantee the assistance of the other Member States for a longer period of time
Instead of a three-year lifetime for claims the committee proposes five years
If the period is made any shorter and there could certainly be reasons for so doing the notice or decision that the attempted recovery has failed will be delivered more rapidly but fewer cases pending does not mean a higher success rate
In addition Member States must accord the same priority to claims from another Member State as they accord to their own claims
Community claims indeed may even take priority over national claims
These statements have only been included in the recitals
We hope that they will ultimately be included in the operative section too but for the time being we are happy to see them in the recitals
At the same time the Member States are absolutely free to decide whether and how the costs are to be shared in cases where recovery causes particular problems or is especially costly for example when it is a matter of trying to combat organised crime
Irrespective of the proposals before us I believe that the Commission still has much to do
For example the training of tax officers in the Member States under the Fiscalis programme needs to be improved
Efforts are also needed to assimilate or at least harmonise the different recovery powers of the various Member States
At all events this is another area where solidarity and mutual trust are indispensable
These qualities are essential to the projects in question
Allow me to say in conclusion that the financial interests of the Community and the Member States as is often the case would be well served by the plans presented here
Not only the Community but also and to a greater extent the Member States will benefit from an efficient recovery procedure
Some of the calls for amendments which the Commission has now answered have come from the Member States
They ought therefore to ensure that the Council makes the right decision
As for the Commission however if you think about the length of time that elapsed before it tabled a proposal the Commission does appear to have been rather dilatory
Madam President on a point of order
I ask for your clarification
The title of the report we are discussing appears to concern the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund but the comments of the rapporteur went very much wider than that subject
Is there an error in some respect in the title or is the report broader than that
Secondly the text of the rapporteur report refers to tax havens and raises that question in relation to Amendment No 
However that amendment does not mention the subject matter
I wonder whether there is another problem with this report there
These are really things which should be discussed in committee However Mr Bardong will say something briefly on that as rapporteur
Madam President I shall be brief The report and even the title of the report are certainly broader or at least cover more types of taxes and public charges than may appear from your documentation
The effects on incomes are clearly formulated in the Commission proposals
All I was criticising was the fact that they do not feature in the title too because I consider them to be important
We are not going to have a debate here which ought in fact to take place in committee
Under which Rule do you wish to raise a point of order Mr Mather
Madam President on a point of order
I seek your guidance again
It seems to me to be dangerous for the Rules of the House and the proceedings if Members are asked to vote on a subject of a report which bears very little relation to the title
Members who look at the titles of reports and think this is limited to agricultural matters 
The President cut the speaker off
I am sorry Mr Mather To repeat we are not going to have a debate here which ought to take place in committee
You could have gone to the committee and expressed your views on this there
Also you did not ask for the floor through your group and you cannot force your way into making a speech now even though you were not down to speak
Everyone might start to do that
You must now listen to what other Members have to say and then we shall vote on the matter
Madam President I did ask for the floor and my name is down on the list to speak at this point
I hope I am not pressurising you unduly on this Friday morning
The title of the directive on which we have to take a decision today could hardly sound more technical but for all that I believe Mr Bardong report manages to pack a powerful political punch
We know that any freedom can be abused
This is also true of the freedoms which the common internal market offers the people of the European Union freedom to travel without frontier checks freedom to settle in another Member State
Welcome though these freedoms may be they have also occasionally been abused for purposes such as tax evasion
The instruments we have today to protect ourselves against such abuses are not effective enough
Since there has been a directive which provides for mutual assistance between Member States but the main purpose of the directive was originally to collect customs duties or levies in the framework of the common agricultural policy
Today with the spiralling volume of intra-Community exchanges this provision is no longer sufficient
That is why the Commission has put forward these proposals on which we have to decide for example the proposal that Member States should be able to collect each other fines and fixed penalties in response to a request for administrative assistance
We in the Socialist Group support this proposal as well as the other proposals because they target all forms of tax evasion and fraud
The Commission is also proposing procedural improvements for example that administrative assistance should be requestable in future even before all domestic means of recovery have been exhausted
This is designed to prevent crafty lawyers from stalling for time and to eliminate abuse of the legal system
As far as the rapporteur amendments are concerned he has our full support for all of them
I shall mention three points some aspects of which have already been addressed by Mr Bardong
Firstly the statute of limitation proposed by the Commission is too short and should be extended from three to five years
This view is substantiated by practical experience in past years
Secondly when a case of enforced recovery relates to both Community claims and claims in favour of a national budget the Community claims should be accorded priority
Thirdly liability for the costs arising from administrative assistance should be determined by common consent between the Member States
The precise division of costs is something that a directive does not have to dictate to Member States
Let me sum up despite the technical nature of your report Mr Bardong it is a very important document that will help to secure the long-term functioning of the common market in the European Union
Madam President Commissioner beyond the technical complexity of the subject after all even the title is quite a mouthful I think this report should be hailed as a further contribution towards achieving the objective so dear to many European citizens namely transparency
Transparency in public administration means rectitude in Community systems for distributing resources and fighting fraud both public and private
The rapporteur reminds us that there has been a strategy for mutual assistance in recovering claims since but because of anomalies in implementation recovery cannot be fully guaranteed for either legitimate creditors or the Community and its budget
The rapporteur whom I compliment on the work he has done mentioned an average recovery figure of % which verges on the ridiculous
This figure is bound to worry people who are talking with increasing conviction of common fiscal systems Community contributions policy and intra-Community VAT and excise regimes
Indeed the introduction of the two latter regimes in has led to a considerable rise in claims to be recovered and many Member States are already demanding their rights
Member States themselves are calling for so-called direct taxation mutual control of potential evaders and the fight against tax havens which are easily established today not only inside the cumbersome banking systems of third countries but also inside those of Member States
It is a bold step from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund to tax havens a strange departure by this report but it serves to demonstrate that large systems including fraudulent ones start small at individual level and then become widespread
That is why the strategy for demolishing them must be based on the general interest but must also be able to reach right down to the very roots of fraud in order to eradicate it
Madam President Mr Bardong report now under discussion focuses on how the recovery of claims agricultural levies customs duties and taxes relating to the EAGGF can be made more effective
The subject is a difficult one as it is a delicate area
I wish to thank Mr Bardong for what is a well prepared and expertly explained report
Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims is becoming ever more important
With the establishment of the single market it will be much easier for those with tax liabilities to move their assets and income from one country to another
There is a danger that tax havens will start forming within the European Union
This would mean conditions that were all too ideal especially for organised crime
The European Union problem is that it has its own budget but does not have the proper machinery to implement it
Member States are taking practical steps to improve the situation regarding both the payment of levies and the recovery of claims
However the Member States are independent economic units which are primarily concerned with their own affairs in respect of revenues and the recovery of other revenues takes second place
Thus only to % of requests for recovery in the EU have been successful
The second problem is that the act of recovery itself the recovery of claims the seizure of property and other matters connected with the process fall under the second pillar of the Union
The matters that fall under this pillar are not a proper part of the EU decision-making process but they do call for cooperation among Member States
Member States are very sensitive to the threat of violation of sovereignty in this area
For that reason the recovery of claims and the degree of cooperation which that demands are politically sensitive questions
Despite everything it is clear that the recovery of claims in respect of taxes and overpayments must be successful in the EU context too
For this reason Mr Bardong report and the Commission proposal are to be strongly supported
Madam President I would like to thank Mr Bardong for all the effort he has put into this important report although I too wish to comment on its title which fails to do justice to the full range of the subject
A large part of the problem could well be that the Commission does not want to admit what is really at stake
The question of how much power the EU should exercise in this area has been the subject of much debate not least in our Member States
Perhaps that is why the Commission is beating about the bush in this way
Several speakers have commented on Amendment No 
The Commission proposes that Articles and should apply only to claims not more than three years old
I believe that it is right for us to be calling for five years since these matters take a great deal of time to process
If the articles in question are to have any impact at all the Member States must have more than three years to complete their work
Amendment No causes some difficulties for me personally
I am not sure that we should be saying that national claims are secondary in importance to claims payable to the Community budget
This strikes me as unfair
My feeling is that national and Community claims should be treated equally it would be wrong to give precedence to one set over the other
As I said however this is my personal view
The Green Group will be supporting the report together with the amendments from Mr Bardong and the Committee on Budgetary Control
This is a good report Madam President
The amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgetary Control are good too
We shall vote in favour of them
All of us here are aware that some shameless debtors may organise their insolvency in such a way that the creditor Member State is obliged to apply to another Member State to whose territory the recalcitrant taxpayer has transferred or where he holds assets that are available for enforcement
I should like now to put a very specific question to Commissioner Bangemann
One scenario envisaged by the Commission as part of Agenda is that Member States should cofinance the CAP
In that case who in the event of fraud will be responsible for recovering sums disbursed in error out of the portion cofinanced by the Member State
How would one recover a sum paid in error to a fraudster who had transferred assets to another Member State or who had assets in another Member State
Before proposing a scenario we need to consider the legal procedures that are essential for it to come about because in this case where operations are cofinanced it is the European institutions which decide on the amount of agricultural aid and thus the amount payable by the Member State in question
The separation between the party deciding and the party paying will pose real legal problems when it comes to debt recovery and these may hamper the implementation of cofinancing as envisaged by the Commission one more obstacle along a road which appears decidedly rocky
Madam President I should like to convey my special thanks to Professor Bardong for his excellent work on an insoluble problem
The report which has been criticised in some points such as the inconsistency between its title and its content shows quite precisely the real sort of jungle in which we find ourselves
I should like to say a few words on that
There have been repeated references in this discussion to tax havens or as we call them in German tax oases
Let us consider what that expression means
Where do we find oases In the desert of course
This means that when we speak of tax oases we have to admit that everything in this landscape that is not an oasis is a desert
That is the very nub of this entire discussion
Our difficulties derive from the build-up of bureaucracies and technocratic measures above all they are indicative of the way in which our whole tax system is becoming increasingly complex and incomprehensible
In that respect the report is truly excellent and I shall vote for it because it is technically correct and shows us precisely where the problem lies namely in the fact that in the individual states but also to some extent in the Union as a whole the situation is becoming ever more complex for our citizens which naturally gives crooks the opportunity to exploit that complexity
I should like to see us addressing that problem very seriously because if we do not establish a clear picture here if we cannot adopt and implement simple solutions we shall continue to have the same problems
Madam President on a point of order
I wish to draw your attention to the fact that during the speech of Mr Souchet and also during part of Mr von Habsburg speech Mr Mather was using a mobile phone which I believe is not allowed in this Chamber
I should perhaps point out again that using mobile phones in the Chamber is not allowed
Please switch them off
Madam President this is indeed a very important report
I have to say that I am not a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control but I am certainly rather confused after everything I have heard
Now I must ask Mr Bangemann this question if the system is extended can it happen that for instance in the case of value-added tax excise duty well just give us some examples of charges that might be covered here
If we were then to have a withholding tax on interest and dividends which heaven forbid what would the situation be with regard to recovery by one country on behalf of another
Please tell us what this monstrous title covers
I am not at all sure any more whether I can support this proposal
Is Commissioner Bangemann prepared to answer that question
Madam President I shall answer any question from Mrs Lulling since she voted in favour of the Commission
Laughter
I shall also answer questions from the Members of Parliament who voted against the Commission though somewhat more briefly
Well Mrs Lulling the areas covered by the draft directive are indicated in the proposal
Claims for value-added tax can certainly be subject to the recovery procedure
It is indeed possible and the proposal refers explicitly to that possibility
At the present time of course we cannot include a reference to a withholding tax on interest and dividends because it does not exist
Should such a tax be introduced a separate provision on its recovery would have to be inserted because that type of tax is not covered by the proposed legislation
Since there is no withholding tax on interest and dividends there are no provisions for its recovery
Should it be introduced against your ardent wishes which are naturally inspired by your concern for the future of Europe and for justice and are totally unconnected to the situation in your own Member State the directive would have to be supplemented so that any outstanding amounts of withholding tax could be recovered
Thank you Mr Bangemann
The debate is closed
We shall now proceed to the vote
Parliament adopted the legislative resolution
European standardisation
The next item is the report A by Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on the report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament Efficiency and Accountability in European Standardisation under the New Approach C
Madam President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen what we have here is a Commission report on efficiency and accountability in European standardisation under the new approach
The new approach for the field of technical harmonisation was introduced in and is based on four principles
Firstly the European legislator sets out the essential health and safety conditions which products must meet before they can be placed on the market
The standards institutes then draw up the technical specifications which the manufacturer needs in order to manufacture products to those requirements
There is however no obligation on the producer to produce on the basis of the standards
Lastly the authorities are required to associate products that comply with the harmonised standards with a presumption of conformity with the essential conditions
The Economic Affairs Committee judges the new approach to be a good one above all because the harmonisation of legislation is restricted to the essential conditions
This is a policy matter and separate from the compilation of technical specifications which is the business of the standards people
In other words every man to his own trade
The market-oriented character of the new approach contrasts too with the mandatory nature of the legislation

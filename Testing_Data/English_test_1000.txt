I was about to raise a very serious incident relating to a power failure at a nuclear power station which had it taken place could have had catastrophic implications
I would like to draw this to your attention
I am always grateful for comments and suggestions from the floor because I believe I need to take everyone views into account to be an effective President
Do bear in mind however Mr McMahon that this afternoon sitting began at exactly pm
Question Time to the Commission should therefore have finished at pm
We ought to be concerned not only for the Members but also for the services working in the House
At present for instance we are running minutes over the finishing time for our services including the interpreters
As you are aware the work of the latter is particularly demanding
As President I do my best to deal fairly with the many supplementary questions which arise but I cannot work miracles
Hence we have run minutes over the time allocated for today and Mrs Bjerregaard has used the time to which she was entitled
I must now close Question Time and thank Mrs Bjerregaard for her replies for being here today and indeed for her patience
Questions Nos to will receive written answers
That concludes questions to the Commission
The sitting was suspended at pm and resumed at pm
Common organisation of the market in wine continuation
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report A by Mr P Martin on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the common organisation of the market in wine CCNS
Mr President I think we need to begin by acknowledging the significant amendments the European Commission is making to the proposal
The image of a wine sector that produces huge surpluses was all that remained of that proposal a proposal we have fortunately moved on from today and which was geared exclusively to the wholesale grubbing-up of vineyards
The current reform however which is today clearly also the subject of discussion and controversy focuses on improving the present balance between supply and demand and above all giving producers the opportunity to adapt to and take advantage of expanding markets
But we should not be overly optimistic
In my opinion the proposals put forward by the European Commission in relation to one of the issues being debated new planting rights seem more fitting than the Committee on Agriculture opinion
I also think that the Commission proposals are better able to provide this guarantee of dynamic equilibrium
What is more it seems more positive to grant % of the replanting rights in relation to the designated wine-growing areas in zones where demand is increasing than to extend the limit to 
Complementary measures in this regard might include permanent grubbing-up measures for regions with structural surpluses and a revised regulation for replanting rights which might extend beyond the wine years after the year in which grubbing-up took place
The chapter on reconversion which also focuses on aligning production to market demands has been concluded positively both in terms of recovering restructuring costs and including the possibility of financing specific measures to support wine making in regions which because of drought have difficult cultivation conditions
However we completely disagree with the fact that Member States may continue to contribute up to % of the cost for production regions located outside of Objective 
As regards market mechanisms we fully endorse the increase in the volume of alcohol in wine-making installations to % from % through the vinification of grape musts
Similarly we think that an important step has been taken as regards the use of specific distillation methods in potable alcohol which means that supplies to the Community sector will be guaranteed a sector that annually demands almost million hectolitres
Lastly in the event of a market disturbance we should like to see the continued application of crisis legislation on a voluntary basis in line with the Commission proposal in Article 
In our opinion it is vital that specific aid and measures for promoting wine consumption and providing consumers with information be included in a new title in the new regulation
From the point of view of who has overall responsibility for these matters the number of important decisions to be taken by the management committee as laid down in Article and subsequent articles seems excessive This is why we endorse measures aimed at restoring balance to the decision-making procedures
Finally we must once again stress our opposition to the oenological practices used to increase levels of alcohol strength through the addition of saccharose This immediately calls into question the definition of wine in Annex where it is defined as the product obtained exclusively from the total or partial alcoholic fermentation of fresh grapes or of fresh grape must
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen with regard to Mr Martin report we should welcome not only the important and high-quality work produced by the rapporteur but also the fact that the time devoted to preparing discussing and organising this work enabled the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to provide Parliament with a good report which is comprehensive and coherent and which was adopted by a large majority
We should be aware that such a result was only possible due to the close dialogue held with wine growers and also because the basic ideas behind the report were inspired by the general report on the reform of the CAP which had already been adopted by Parliament
This also means that in several areas the report does not follow the liberal proposals made by the Commission
The report therefore maintains a definition of the quality of wine an agricultural and viticultural product and in this way rejects all forms of industrialisation
It affirms Europe intention to increase its share of world production of quality wine which is linked to human health when consumed in moderation
In order to achieve this the report proposes controlling the expansion of vineyards notably for the benefit of young farmers and a more efficient measure for replanting and improvements to vineyard management techniques
Finally all of this must be guaranteed by regulated management which includes promotion and adjustment instruments such as compulsory distillation and which must not be left to the responsibility of the Commission
I strongly support the priority given within such a framework to enrichment by grape musts rather than by sugaring the ban on the import of musts from third countries which would be a Trojan horse for the quality of European production the ban on blending white wine and red wine and finally the clear definition of the specific characteristics of each wine product natural sweet wines for example are the only product capable of maintaining a level of human economic activity in certain areas of production of the Union
Everyone can see that the draft CAP reforms tend to become embedded in the rut defined by the Commission too liberal tendencies
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is very attentive to the demands of the experts and of society
This is why we will be approving the report which has been presented to us
Mr President today the round of debates on the reform of the CAP within the framework of Agenda comes to an end
These debates have revealed how difficult it is to find a common denominator which will reconcile national interests which are divided by profound and increasingly visible differences
I hope that the debate on wine-growing will benefit the wine producer the product and the consumer alike
Our rapporteur Mr Martin has contributed substantially towards this
If nothing else wine has brought people together from time immemorial and has been an important element in social cultural and religious life
As far as an appreciation of the Commission proposal is concerned it represents in principle a step forwards in tackling the problems faced by the sector
The complex regulatory framework which has thus far taken shape is an obstacle to attaining market equilibrium developing productive capacity improving the quality of wine and promoting products on the European and global market
The current policy of grubbing up vines has resulted in a % reduction in the area given over to vines in the EU which is being inundated with wine from third countries thanks to their aggressive production and marketing policy
In Greece in particular there has been a % reduction which is threatening the quality of Greek vineyards as the abovementioned policy has primarily affected vineyards of local varieties of high quality but with a limited production capacity
For this reason at least % must be se aside for new planting rights in order to enable European vineyards to make the necessary quality adjustments especially in the regions which have been damaged most by the grubbing-up policy
As regards trade with third countries we cannot accept a proposal which allows grape must to be imported from third countries for use in wine production
With regard to wine-making practices and the possibility of increasing the alcoholic content of wine with sugar we must maintain the status quo the historical continuity of a product which is pre-eminently traditional
I would like to end with a word about the problems faced by island vineyards and vineyards in mountainous regions especially in Greece where production is dispersed over small-scale vineyards in just such regions
The special soil and climatic conditions favour the production of high-quality products which the consumer wants but production costs are high and constitute an inhibitory factor
The new COM must provide a special support structure for these crops
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I should also like to congratulate Mr Martin not only on his excellent report but also on his tireless efforts in the search for agreements and compromises
I should also like to congratulate the Commission because on this occasion it has put forward a proposal which differs radically from the famous proposal it unfortunately put forward in 
This time the proposal is better adapted to the current needs and concerns of the sector and therefore constitutes a valid starting point to allow Parliament and the Council to reach important agreements
I should like to concentrate here on three of the fundamental issues approved by Parliament
First safeguard clauses have been included in the recitals articles and provisions on repeal which in spite of the repeal of more than Council regulations are aimed at guaranteeing future respect for the acquis communautaire in the area of quality wines produced in specific regions
Second with regard to the distillation of table wines to obtain alcohol for potable uses I should like to thank the rapporteur for having accepted our amendments and for having included them in the final version
This has meant that the aid set for table wines to be distilled for potable uses will definitely not be set at the Commission discretion Instead the Commission will have to set the aid in proportion to the needs to supply potable alcohol to those sectors which according to the rules are obliged to use it
Brandy and liqueur wine production will be safeguarded as a consequence and the production of more than hectares of vines and thousands of jobs in vineyards wine-cellars related industries andancillary services will be maintained
It is crucial for this aid to be set at a level which guarantees the competitiveness of by-products of wine for potable uses If both the by-products of wine and the aid given for these products were to disappear the cost of the by-products used to make brandy would increase by % whereas alcoholic products made from molasses and cereals would remain stable
This would increase the current price differences in alcoholic wine products and force drinks that have to use the by-products of wine off the market
Moreover Parliament has improved the Commission proposal by setting out the ways in which the aid given will be annually reviewed and precisely how primary and secondary aid will be monitored
And as in previous amendments that I tabled in the House I believe that this will guarantee the prices of potable alcohol as well as an annual minimum distillation volume of million hectolitres
Lastly I welcome the Committee on Agriculture decision to accept separate technical definitions for fortified wine and fortified liqueur wine in Annex 
The particular production methods and organoleptic characteristics of these types of wine mean that they are differentiated and distinct and as such merit a separate definition
The proposal for a reform offers a welcome opportunity to set out an independent and distinct definition of these fortified wines which were not and are not the same as the liqueur wines mentioned in the original COM in wine
And in terms of geographical appellation surface area of the vineyard wine producing and wine making trade and job creation they mean far more than other products that are defined separately in the basic regulation of the original COM
Mr President this proposal encourages and promotes free imports of wines and musts from third countries destined to be mixed with Community wines
The Council and Commission forget that there are Community wines of a very special quality which can enrich the quality of Community wines in a most wonderful and natural way It is not necessary to import such wines from third countries
They also forget the relentless way in which the vineyards have been targeted over many years
Tens of thousands of hectares of vines have been grubbed up at a rate which has been very detrimental to Greece
This tragic situation is very difficult to reconcile with the approach you are taking today unless of course there are ulterior motives and dubious interests at work
You are promoting a moratorium on planting and you want to restrict wine growing push it to the brink and perhaps even create a shortfall to justify opening the floodgates to imports to serve the interests of the WTO and GATT thereby obtaining compensation in other sectors which interest you
You are allowing sugar to be added to Community wines especially to German wines in order to increase the alcohol content
This is inconsistent with the restriction on production and the quality that you are after
If you wish to favour Germany then at least have the sugar content written on the product
Finally Mr President this proposal upgrades the institution of the inter-branch organisations and aims to force the poor wine grower to compete on the same terms as the ruthless industrial processors of this precious commodity
You are sacrificing this product Commissioner and you are sacrificing it to illicit questionable interests
You forget that it is not simply a product it is a popular form of sustenance and it provides excellent employment
Wine is civilisation it is tradition and culture
Do not forget that
There are countries in which since the time of Homer people have been brought up with this culture of wine
And you are sacrificing it on the altar of questionable multinational interests
Mr President I too believe that Mr Martin has done a good job overall particularly bearing in mind the outcome secured in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development as compared with the others
Nonetheless I am not one of those satisfied with the end result and I therefore did not vote in favour in the Committee on Agriculture
I think more can be done and will therefore discuss two aspects in particular that I believe to be gaps about which I am dissatisfied
My first point concerns the reinclusion of compulsory distillation which had actually been removed from the Commission proposal
This proposal is contradictory we cannot demand on the basis of the market equilibrium that has now been achieved to be allowed to launch a policy of replanting and renewing vines while once again proposing compulsory distillation
I think this is a contradiction that has to be resolved by the vote in plenary and our action as I suggested earlier in the price package must be based primarily on a policy of replanting or intelligent grubbing-up managed on a regional basis within the European Union
I believe this is the policy that must be pushed forward combined with the flexible adaptable and creative approach that other honourable Members have already mentioned
I believe this is a problem that must be remedied
At any rate all we Italian Members will be working for that not least in the vote in plenary
My second point concerns our conception of quality
Many Members in this House have spoken about quality and the need to protect the agricultural origin of the wine and the product itself however no effort has been made to work towards harmonisation not even of production and vinification methods
I recognise that it is difficult to ban the addition of sucrose but all the same something could be done to improve quality measures could be taken regarding the level of minimum must content or labelling or we could leave things as they are but find a way of rewarding those countries with the best record on this
But nothing significant has been done here
And that is why without wishing to start a revolution we shall again be raising the issue of quality rather more seriously and consistently
Finally it is worth pointing out that we are discussing a sector that has been penalised in terms of resources it is accorded half of what it contributes to European agriculture GDP
More must be done to promote the product on the international markets
Mr President ladies and gentlemen Philippe-Armand Martin report modifies some aspects of the Commission proposal
These changes are mostly positive ones and take account of the amendments that we tabled and adopted in the Agriculture Committee
They include the possibility of renewing vineyards and aid for promoting consumption in the internal and external markets and banning products made from musts originating in third countries or prohibiting imports of such musts for vinification
Lastly I would like to refer to our acceptance of crisis distillation and the introduction of certain aids albeit insufficient for producer organisations and vines planted in less-favoured areas
However we cannot go on allowing wine a Mediterranean product accounting for around % of the Community agricultural production to be funded by only % of the agriculture budget whilst arable crops which chiefly concern the countries of central and northern parts of the EU receive % of that budget although they account for less than % of Community agricultural production
This is just one more example of the clear discrimination that will still exist between different crops after this reform
We also think it is unacceptable for products resulting from processes such as sugaring to raise alcohol content to be called wine
We are therefore tabling certain amendments which we hope will be approved making it compulsory to include this on the labels of such products to inform and protect consumers and also to set a five-year deadline for ending once and for all the practice of adding sugar to wine
Mr President Commissioner for at least seven or eight years now we have been discussing wine and the now notorious reform of the wine sector
As you will be aware Commissioner back in for instance proposals were tabled on which I had the honour to act as rapporteur in the House in 
So this particular wine has been tasted at some length
That shows both how complex and controversial reform of the sector is but it also demonstrates that clouds do sometimes have a silver lining
And that is fortunate because the failure to implement the old concept of reform has been a blessing for European wine-producers
That reform was finally shelved and what we have on the table today as previous speakers have rightly pointed out are other ideas which are certainly an improvement on the past
The fact is that the fundamental approach taken previously was flawed
I recall that your predecessor Commissioner Steichen predicted that come the year there would be a million hectolitre wine surplus that was used to justify adopting drastic and extremely punishing measures inspired by the pessimism of the bureaucrats which would have been highly damaging to Europe wine growers
In point of fact there have been no surpluses for some years now and that change of fortune is I believe not the work of Bacchus but a result of the extensive grubbing-up and the ban on replanting during that period which substantially impoverished European vineyards and left us with ageing vine stocks
Europe has therefore lost ground in an art in which it has been and remains the world leader
Of course that has caused some alarm bells to ring
Competition from new European producers is beginning to have a significant impact within Europe too
In the space of a few years imports of wine from outside Europe have doubled
There are countries where costs are far lower than they are here countries that enjoy far greater freedom of movement and which are not restricted by the bureaucratic obstacles and red tape that have always plagued European wine growers
And so this new and sensible approach is welcome I acknowledge that Commissioner Fischler
With this new proposal the Commission is I think taking a fresh approach based on the premiss that we now need to help a sector which has in recent years achieved market equilibrium and must therefore avoid adopting measures that could destroy it
In my view the best remedy is a good dose of liberalisation
I realise that coming from a Socialist that may sound surprising but the wine sector in particular shows that excessive regulation can also be fatal
And so we need to take a more dynamic approach to Europe vineyards there has to be advance replanting extensive restructuring of vineyards and higher allocations than currently provided for in the Commission proposal
Indeed I share the view expressed by previous speakers that more must be done to restore balance
We have an agricultural policy under which products continue to be protected by applying two different sets of criteria a policy under which there is a huge gulf between the support given to products from central and northern Europe and the support given to Mediterranean products
I think that the rapporteur has done a good job but not good enough the report is sound on a number of controversial issues such as the import of musts the powers of the Commission and the efforts made to make Europe vineyards more dynamic
On two points however which have already been mentioned by Mr Filippi we are unable to agree with Commissioner Fischler principally the questions of compulsory distillation and the addition of sucrose
I do not agree with the point concerning compulsory distillation because the Commission has proposed optional crisis distillation which I consider to be the right response to the new market dynamic
As far as the addition of sucrose is concerned I am well aware of the fact that anyone tackling this problem runs enormous risks in particular the risk of blocking all the rest of the reform
Nonetheless it would have been worth taking account of the existing differences and inequities and sending out the message which we are always calling for that European producers must enjoy equal worth and show solidarity
We are always talking about quality well I believe that quality also means giving priority to products wholly derived from the vine
Mr President Commissioner I hope it has been worth the wait
After the abortive proposal to reform the Common Organisation of the Market in Wine in and following our proposed amendments in the Commission has certainly taken its time in submitting a new proposal for reform
However it has now adopted a more positive approach and it is indeed inconceivable that we should think of meddling with Europe wine-growing potential with all its tradition and its wonderful variety and simply abandon the European internal market and the world market to competition from third countries whatever the World Trade Organisation may say
The human race would be healthier if far more people could afford to drink one two or even three glasses of wine every day
The way to meet such a level of demand is not compulsory distillation or grubbing-up but a far higher production levelof quality wines especially in the Community and of course far lower excise duties than those currently levied in many Member States particularly in the north of the EU
Having said that I am delighted that thanks to the enormous amount of work put in by our rapporteur Mr Martin whom I would like to thank very sincerely the Agriculture Committee has managed to make some real improvements to the Commission proposal This has involved some sensible compromises and to achieve these compromises we have all had to mix a little water with our wine
I am sorry that despite all these efforts some of our colleagues from the south have again gone on the war-path against the centuries-old wine-growing practices in the north of the Community
And the strange idea some people have that wine growers not using enrichment should be given additional planting rights is simply crazy
I personally can agree to the compromise which took so much hard work to achieve
I can live with it especially because overall it represents a positive approach to maintaining and increasing marketable wine production which after all makes a magnificent contribution to preserving our wonderful landscape not least in my own country
But the Agriculture Committee proposals are also well-balanced and sensible when it comes to wine-growing practices new planting rights and flexible measures in the event of poor weather conditions or unusually abundant grape harvests where maximum yields are involved
I would ask the Commission and Mr Fischler in particular to adopt our proposals for the additional chapter on special aid and support measures for wine products and for the involvement of trade organisations in this
I would be pleased if he could confirm this today
The proposals also include initiatives to promote moderate wine consumption and advertising campaigns outside the Community
That is the right way to go
I hope that the Commission and the Council of Ministers will support us in this and that a substantial majority of this House will vote for it as a large majority for this sensible compromise is our best chance of making our voice heard in the Council of Ministers
Mr President I wish to point out that firstly vineyards are just recovering from the shock of large-scale grubbing-up Secondly they are suffering massive discrimination
Statistics given by the Commissioner show that in a dairy company received an average of ECU million from the EAGGF a combined meat and dairy company received ECU arable farmers received ECU while a wine-producing company received on average ECU 
The figures speak for themselves
We are concerned about what is happening and I wish to highlight the following important points
Firstly sugar is used for making cakes and pastries not wine
Existing regulations and their planned extension will in my opinion undermine the essence of the European Union wine-producing proposal and position
Secondly do we not want to improve the quality of our wines
We have must within the Community which is of excellent quality and we do not need to turn to imports from third countries
Thirdly to alleviate the shock caused by grubbing-up there must be an increase in planting which can start with the % which is being debated
Fourthly we believe that distillation is not something we can impose willy-nilly on the producers
They produce wine
If they want to carry out distillation this should be left up to them as it is now and we should not legislate to make distillation compulsory
Finally Mr President I think that special measures are needed for vineyards in mountainous and island regions
Mr President I am sorry to see that the idea of insisting on bottling at source has crept into Mr Martin otherwise excellent report
Insisting on bottling at source is a well-meaning and naive attempt to protect jobs and the reputation of the wines from particular wine-growing regions
Unfortunately with respect it shows an enormous ignorance of what actually happens to wine in those countries that it is shipped to
Nor does it recognise the changing way in which wine is distributed marketed or consumed especially in northern Europe
On arrival the wines are specially packed to meet the needs of the particular markets
They are canned or boxed with the supermarkets own labels or they are placed in specialist chilled containers for the restaurant and pub market for easy sale by the glass
I am assured that bulk imports in the UK are carefully protected by making sure that the right label goes on the right wine
They do not put the word Bordeaux on a bottle of wine or a can of wine that has come from a third country
They make certain that their computerised systems respect quality The bottlers have an interest in ensuring that they are seen to be selling quality wines
It may be that we need to ensure that these control systems are transparent and obvious to all
Perhaps this is something we can discuss in detail during the passage of Mrs Lulling report at some point in the future
But please do not let us risk job losses in our own wine areas and possibly creating problems for our own bottlers by creating barriers between producers distributors and consumers which are artificial and will damage trade within the Union
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen the importance of the wine sector in the rural economy of the European Union is recognised by all
However it must be pointed out that this is due to Europe dominant international position Europe share of the production in this sector is % and moreover % of this is exported
So you may ask why have a market organisation
Well quite simply because the economy is increasingly becoming a global one and we have to adopt Community rules in order to organise ourselves properly in view of this globalisation
That is why I consider it useful to emphasise certain aspects of the report which are of major importance to wine growing in Europe
As regards the planting of vines we have made great efforts over the past ten years to reduce the areas under vines
From now on if we need to know how to grub up vines in certain fragile zones we should also know how to replant them taking into account the requirements and demand for quality
This is why we must show flexibility and allow expanding regions to meet demand by replanting vines while reducing surpluses in certain areas
As for oenological practices I am very concerned by what I have just heard
As a Frenchman in the heart of Europe I would say this to you let us put an end to this war waged by the Gauls in southern Europe against those in northern Europe and let us respect the traditions inherited from our ancestors which are accepted and effective
We are fighting amongst ourselves and our attitudes are equally rigid
As regards the wine industry it is clear that it is the close cooperation between production and trade that has established satisfactory trade patterns for both the consumer and the quality of the wine appreciated by him
This is why we need to respect the organisations set up in our regions and above all the crucial role they play in adapting resources to requirements
As far as exports are concerned let us know how to open up our markets to the outside world and provide the means to promote communications on product quality in Europe
Finally it is in this spirit and on the basis of a Commission proposal which seemed to us overcautious and at times Malthusian and too bureaucratic that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has examined the report on the COM in wine
Numerous meetings and discussions have enabled us to arrive at the compromise reflected in the text which has been presented to you
Ladies and gentlemen from both North and South we must vote in favour of this report
It represents significant progress in comparison with the proposal and it should ensure that our opinion is taken into account by the Council
At any rate I sincerely hope this is the case
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen it is the diversity its variety the special characteristics the taste and last but not least the way it is identified with specific regions that ultimately sets European wine apart
We now find ourselves faced with the difficult task of trying to regulate this diversity within a Common Market Organisation and to regulate it in such a way that this diversity is preserved
We do not want a uniform European wine but we do want a legal framework that is workable
I come from one of Europe northern wine-growing areas from the Mosel region
Our wines grow in different climatic conditions which makes them different but they have their connoisseurs and there is certainly a market for them
I would like to thank the Commission and our rapporteur Mr Martin and also the Agriculture Committee for making it possible to reach a compromise on this common organisation for wine which in recognition of the specific characteristics of individual regions provides for traditional wine-growing practices to be maintained
This means the wine from Europe regions that we know and appreciate will be preserved
Jobs in upstream and downstream sectors will also be preserved as will our agricultural landscapes
You can regulate the market but you cannot regulate nature the weather and the harvest
I am therefore in favour of setting a quantity of wine that can be marketed in any given year
Our wine-growing regions have already set corresponding maximum yields per hectare
But I am vehemently opposed to the Commission proposal that if the yield per hectare is exceeded by % the entire harvest would lose the right to be designated as quality wine
Up to now quality wine has not been regulated in this way
Every farmer and every wine grower is dependent on the weather and good years are needed to compensate for bad ones
Wine from years when there was a good harvest can be marketed during years with poorer yields as a way of ensuring the income of family businesses
So we should allow carry-over
I would particularly ask you to consider this point again
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I should firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and on the level of consensus reached in the House which is something that has not been easy
This issue is still pending from the CAP reform and the Commission proposal is of vital importance for the present and above all the future of this sector especially given the crossroads European wine making has reached
We need the instruments to enable us to be competitive in today open market and to enable the European Union to maintain its position as world leader in this sector a sector which has an enormous added value in both social and economic terms
The consensus reached clearly respects the specific traditional qualities and the various oenological practices that exist and also lays great emphasis on quality and promotion both inside and outside the European Union What is more it enables European wine making to enjoy moderate and controlled growth
As regards alcohol and other related issues I shall try not to repeat everything that has already been said but I should like to stress the need to strike a balance between the technical progress made and the need to preserve the specific characteristics of European wine
This is something else that the reform must resolve
As a result demand for European wine in an increasingly open market would increase if it were more competitive and if such competitiveness was not solely confined to vineyards but also extended to include improved installations as was mentioned and wine promotion that is linked to the dissemination of the results of scientific research on wine
We are also in favour of the creation of a standing committee for wine exports as we believe this is vital
Commissioner there is however one other issue which concerns me namely wine making which purports to be European but which uses grape musts that have been imported from third countries
Can you comment on this
In my view Commissioner you have a golden opportunity to adopt the amendments approved by the House and in particular the consensus reached here which we have worked hard to achieve
Indeed we must admit that some have worked harder than others Nonetheless I believe that this would be in the interests of European wine making for you to adopt these amendments
Mr President Commissioner as far as I can see I am the last speaker
Well we have drained this particular bottle and as often happens we are left with the lees that could have clouded the wine
Thank goodness I am as I said the last speaker yes indeed because I think that the Commission proposal is a sound one I think the rapporteur has shown admirable zeal taking the diplomatic rather than the technical approach and yet for me the reform and the outcome of this work are something of a hollow victory
In politics there is a tendency to evaluate any given issue depending on whether you come to it from the Left or the Right
When we discuss agriculture we inevitably return Mrs Lulling to the old way of looking at a problem as perceived from the North or the South
Despite the best of intentions that gap has yet to be bridged in fact the gulf is still very wide
This could have been an opportunity for trying to reach across it but for reasons that other Italian colleagues have already explained we cannot be optimistic about the chances of what I would venture a little exaggeratedly perhaps to describe as an almost epoch-making recovery from an age-old handicap and it will be a few years yet before there is any possibility of even a partial recovery
However I do not wish to cloud the issue of the wine at all
There are some positive aspects and I would like to mention one or two of them
First we have the move towards quality and the promotion of wine as a drink that is completely harmless and digestible suitable for all ages and all tables then there is the aid for vineyard restructuring replacing table wines with quality wines in addition we have aid for young producers and for disadvantaged mountain regions
Those elements with which I cannot agree are however the dearth of protection against wine from third countries and the excessive focus on the technical aspects of cultivation and bottling with less attention paid to the aspects of production
Unsatisfactory also is the drive towards replacing saccharose with concentrated and rectified must with all the necessary incentives for reasons already explained by other colleagues
Finally I come to compulsory distillation I have to wag my finger at my old friend Mr Martin here
It was an excellent idea on the part of the Commissioner and the Commission to get rid of compulsory distillation and keep only crisis distillation
For reasons that I have yet to understand our friend Mr Martin has sought to reinstate it
It is up to you to redress the balance Commissioner
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would firstly like to thank you all for the work you have put into examining the Commission proposal on the market in wine
And I would especially like to thank Mr Martin as rapporteur for his analysis of the proposal and above all and this has already been acknowledged by several speakers for his efforts to achieve a compromise
By virtue of all these efforts we have been able to ensure that the proposal for the wine sector will not slip behind the other Agenda reform proposals
As you know this proposal is intended to replace existing Council regulations to achieve simplification and to cover all basic areas from the vine to the labelled product
Although the final list of amendments is rather long I am still pleased to see that there are many important subjects on which we are at one
In particular we are in agreement that quality is essential to maintain and improve the competitiveness of Community wine and that the conversion measures planned should play an important part in achieving this objective
We are also agreed that the market position requires more flexible administration of production potential
There is also agreement that we must preserve the specific character of all Community wines and provide a legal basis for this by means of regulations on traditional winemaking methods
Before I respond to your amendments in more detail allow me to remind you once again of the seven objectives of the Commission reform proposal
First we want to make the wine sector more competitive
Second we want to maintain the improved balance between supply and demand
Third we want to eliminate the availability of intervention as an artificial outlet for surplus production
Fourth we want to continue to maintain all traditional outlets for potable alcohol and other products
Fifth we want to accommodate regional diversity
Sixth we want to strengthen the role of producer organisations and inter-branch organisations
And seventh we want to considerably simplify the legislative framework and make it more transparent
There is a large degree of agreement on these objectives
Some of your amendments suggest improvements in the measures we have proposed in order to realise these objectives
In particular we consider the new wording of the provisions on the creation of a legal framework for producer organisations and inter-branch organisations to be a very constructive proposal
I hope that will answer Mrs Lulling question
We have already started to discuss this
Other helpful amendments are those on the introduction of criteria for triggering crisis distillation new rules for liqueur wines and a whole series of technical improvements
However there are also areas where we differ and I would like to discuss those in rather more detail today
In order to give areas where production cannot keep pace with demand an opportunity for some limited expansion the Commission is proposing an allocation of newly created planting rights totalling some hectares
Spread over a period of three years this is nearly twice as much as the additional rights granted under the last two agriculture price packages
Furthermore the proposal that producers undertaking to grub up areas under vines will simultaneously be granted replanting rights will also lead to a considerable expansion in production potential
This expansion could even be substantially greater than the hectares which we are to achieve with the additional percentage
So I cannot see any scope for us to go any further as we would otherwise jeopardise the objective of balancing supply and demand
In one amendment there is a call for the inclusion of pure and simple renewal of vineyards in the restructuring measures
I would like to remind you that the restructuring measures are intended to help to adjust production in certain problem areas to changes in market demand
Of course we only have limited means at our disposal and we cannot therefore afford to finance measures which up to now have always been part of normal vineyard management
Again on restructuring measures you have suggested that restructuring costs outside Objective areas should be cofinanced by up to % by Member States
I recognise that cofinancing is still under discussion but a final decision on that will have to be taken as part of the Agenda package
This therefore needs to be dealt with separately from the common organisation for wine as part of the overall financing of Agenda 
Certain other amendments raised doubts about the status quo as regards enrichment especially enrichment by sugaring
I have to agree with Mr Bébéar in this case I think it is years too late for us to start thinking about waging a new war between the southern and northern states
So I believe that we are right in sticking to the various traditional enrichment methods or oenological practices
As regards the amendments concerning the proposed crisis distillation measure I am firmly convinced that the Commission approach is the right one
Compulsory measures are inappropriate in the more open market which has prevailed since the Uruguay Round in which minimum prices can no longer be set as the withdrawal of quantities of wine would simply result in making room for additional imports
However I can accept your proposal to incorporate additional criteria for triggering the measure in the Council text particularly those on market prices
Another amendment calls for the common market organisation to include measures for internal and external sales promotion
I would like to be clear about this I think that external sales promotion would be more effective in a horizontal regulation
But I am of course in favour of external sales promotion measures
However I think that the various views of the Member States on the promotion of sales in the internal market and the overall stance of the Member States on the sale or promotion of sales of alcoholic drinks would make it difficult to include this in the common organisation of the market in wine
With regard to lifting the current ban on producing wine from must originating from third countries a subject several Members touched upon I am conscious how strongly some Member States feel about this provision
We have taken detailed advice from various experts and have received clear legal opinions indicating that our WTO obligations quite simply require us to lift the present general ban
The Commission has nevertheless explained to the Member States that our proposal will very probably include provisions on controls and labelling including a scheme for depositing an import security in order to guarantee that wine made from third country must cannot be regarded as Community wine
Lastly a number of amendments have been tabled about quality wines produced in specified regions
I would like to make it clear that we intend to adopt the provisions of the current Council regulations in their entirety
Nevertheless we want to limit the Council regulations to general provisions and to cover the remaining provisions in implementing regulations With regard to maximum yields of quality wine the Commission has already taken this opportunity to draw up a common scheme for cases where a maximum yield is exceeded so that uniform conditions are guaranteed for Community producers of quality wine
As long as Member States can settle this question efficiently themselves by means of transparent provisions at national level then we could revisit this proposal and thus take account of Mrs Klaß concerns
Lastly I would like to discuss an amendment affecting various parts of the proposal
This calls for various Council decisions affecting market organisation to be subject to Parliament opinion
Although I regard this as an excellent decision-making procedure for major changes and above all changes of policy it is simply too slow and cumbersome for purely technical market organisation measures where decisions are needed so that we can react promptly to the market situation
It is precisely for that reason that we have made a conscious decision to cover basic principles in a Council regulation whilst decisions on market organisation are to be made at Commission level
This is intended to maximise flexibility and ensure a rapid response
I cannot therefore accept any amendments that would jeopardise this objective
I hope that my comments have made the Commission position on the amendments included in the report sufficiently clear
In conclusion I would like to stress once again the large measure of agreement which is apparent on many important questions
Mr President I was thoroughly confused by Commissioner Fischler explanation about imports of must from third countries for vinification
I did not understand his explanation Does the Commissioner realise what an explosive decision it would be to allow this precedent
Mr President I really thought that my explanation on that point was very clear
I clearly stated that the present GATT rules do not allow us to keep a ban on imports of must
If we are to comply with GATT we have to change this
However what we very probably can do is to ensure that imported must even if it is mixed with musts produced in the Community is adequately labelled so that anyone can see that the wine in question has been produced from imported musts
So it is a question of ensuring that consumers can see that a wine containing imported must is indeed a wine that is either partly or entirely produced from imported must
But we cannot simply ban imports of must
Thank you Mr Fischler
The debate is closed
The vote will take place on Thursday at am
Crossing of EU external borders
Mr President Commissioners ladies and gentlemen thegovernments of the Member States have now accepted the fact that asylum policy can no longer be dealt with at national level only
The Amsterdam Treaty has confirmed this view by making it possible to eventually make asylum a Community policy with qualified majority voting in the Council
However time is short and such an uncertain time-limit for harmonising Member States practice is not feasible
Several attempts have been made under the third pillar and we must hope that these will be transposed promptly into Community law
The Dublin Convention has entered into force but several problems have been observed with its implementation
The Council resolution on minimum guarantees for asylum procedures comprises some positive developments but we regret that its provisions are not binding
The Council Joint Position of March on the harmonised implementation of the definition of the term refugee endorses a restrictive interpretation of the Geneva Convention which excludes persons persecuted by third parties from being granted refugee status and creates situations which are difficult to manage and tragic in human terms
The successive proposals for a joint action on temporary protection which seek to provide a response in the event of massive inflows of displaced persons have met with difficulties in the Council
There is an area where progress has not been made on harmonisation and that is forms of protection complementary to the Geneva Convention although it has been included as an item in the Council programme for several years
In fact the Geneva Convention does not cover all situations involving persons who have fled their country of origin and cannot or do not wish to return because they have justified fears of being persecuted
Even if the Geneva Convention were interpreted in accordance with the UNHCR recommendations which is what we are firmly calling for in this report a legal vacuum would still continue to exist between the level of protection guaranteed by the Geneva Convention and the temporary protection currently under discussion which is only applicable to massive influxes of refugees and therefore excludes individual cases
At present solutions where they exist are left to the discretion of the national authorities and they differ widely to say the least
What happens to nonsuited persons according to the terms of the Geneva Convention who would be in serious danger were they to return to their country of origin
Fortunately the majority remain within the territory of the Union and we will see under what conditions they do so
However we must not forget that some are sent back regardless of the danger and putting their lives at risk as several tragic cases have demonstrated
The situation is becoming so worrying that for example in my country the situation in other Member States not being any better NGOs which do not have a reputation for following hardline or irresponsible policies have set off alarm bells denouncing the ridiculous bureaucratic demands made on displaced persons reporting incidents of torture or degrading treatment
These organisations deplored the decline in recognition rates for the status afforded under the Convention and the tragic situation of nonsuited persons some of whom were convinced that their applications would be rejected and no longer dared to request refugee status
They advocated a change in our way of thinking and a return to a code of ethics based on precautionary action
As regards nonsuited persons who are not sent back to their country of origin what conditions are they offered
They are subject to national provisions in the host country which vary extremely widely
These range from those who are fortunate enough to enjoy genuine protection complementing refugee status to those who are merely tolerated and do not have refugee status or rights and whose situation is totally unstable precarious and constantly being called into question
Current national provisions where they exist differ widely in the various Member States and often even within a Member State
Who benefits from this kind of inextricable labyrinth
Evidently not the interested parties but neither the Member States which cannot expect asylum applications to be distributed in a coherent fashion and are faced with the problems that arise from the presence of less advantaged people in society
The aim of my report is to bring to the attention of the Commission and the Council the urgent need to make headway on the harmonisation of these complementary forms of protection and to define refugee status and rights thereby making it possible for those persons who will remain on the territory of the Union in any case to extricate themselves from precarious and distressing circumstances
These forms of complementary protection must not call into question the full implementation of the Geneva Convention and must at the same time be clearly distinguished from temporary protection
As regards the amendments the majority of those proposed aim to alter the meaning of the text considerably and in fact appear to conflict with the actual object of the report
Everyone will therefore understand why I am rejecting them
I would have liked to agree to the ARE Group amendments concerning the persecution of homosexuals
However I understood that agreeing to them could negate the lengthy consultation process with members of other groups and when all is said and done the final vote could be jeopardised
I will therefore be asking my group to reject them
I should like to conclude by thanking the many Members who have contributed to this report which I hope will eventually establish a practice in the area of EU asylum policy that is more in keeping with the international undertakings to which the Member States have subscribed and with the humanitarian principles on which our Union is based
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I am presenting two reports here today
The first is about the Convention on third-country nationals and the second is about the harmonisation of visa law within the European Union
I would like to start with the Convention on third-country nationals which is certainly the more complex legislative project
I believe that within a functioning European Union internal market we need to have close cooperation on immigration and of course on the rights of third-country nationals who are long-term residents
It makes no sense using Schengen and other provisions to abolish borders if at the same time there are large numbers of third-country nationals living here whose freedom of movement within the internal market is very limited and if there are in any case different immigration regulations in the Member States
This can lead to cases where some Member States admit immigrants who then of course find their way onto the internal labour market as a whole ultimately contributing to the impact I do not want to say burden on other Member States
That is why I very warmly welcome the fact that the European Commission has brought forward a proposal for a Convention on third-country nationals
I think that this in itself is a step forward
Unfortunately the history of Parliament consultation on the Convention on third-country nationals is not a happy one
You will recall that we concluded our discussion of this Convention in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs last summer and that the final debate on it was to take place in the plenary in September
At that point the Socialist Group requested that the Convention on third-country nationals be referred back to the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and I supported this
The reason was quite simple at that time a series of highly controversial changes had been made in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and submitted to the plenary
These included an almost unlimited extension of the right to reunification to all members of the immediate family including grandparents
The existence of a partner relationship was to be adequate justification for family reunification
Opportunities for seasonal workers to repeatedly enter into rolling contracts were extended
The mere offer of a job was to be sufficient to justify immigration rights
Expulsion for serious criminal offences was to be abolished
All this would have led to overloaded labour markets and social systems in the Member States of the European Union
Apparently the very people who supported the amendments got cold feet and then quite sensibly requested referral back to committee
At that point I attempted as rapporteur to find compromise solutions
I believe that the report before us today is a genuine compromise and that an attempt has been made to reconcile the various points of view within the committee
On family reunification we have gone no further than the Commission proposal
Regarding seasonal workers we have given the principle of subsidiarity priority in the individual Member States
We have also been guided by the principle of subsidiarity in the case of making jobs available in Member States
At the same time and I always thought this was correct we have quite simply deleted Chapter from the Convention entirely This chapter refers to the rights of third-country nationals who are long-term residents of the European Union
We have done this because we believe that as its name implies the Convention should deal with immigration and not the rights of third-country nationals who are long-term residents
However we are at the same time calling on the Commission to submit a new proposal to Parliament dealing with the rights of third-country nationals who are long-term residents of the European Union in a separate draft because that of course also needs to be legislated for
Furthermore we in the committee have gathered from preliminary discussions with Commission officials that in view of Parliament opinion on the third-country nationals convention and in view of the Council reaction to it at first reading the Commission in any case intends formally to withdraw this draft Convention and rework it with a view to reviving it as a proposal for a directive once the Treaty of Amsterdam has entered into force
I welcome this and I am sure that it will also be welcomed by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs
I believe that a revised Commission proposal would provide a more appropriate basis for discussion than has been the case up to now
I would like to stress that I intend to reject the amendments tabled by the ARE Group the GUE Group and the Liberal Group purely and simply because these amendments effectively resuscitate ideas from the first consultation in September which I rejected for the reasons I have already stated and which I have no alternative but to reject again now
Let me make myself very clear if these groups amendments were to be adopted I would be forced after the votes had been taken to ask the House to reject my own report
That is why I am asking you to reject these amendments
Now for the second report on what is known as the visa directive This too has a rather unfortunate history
You will recall that the European Parliament gave its opinion on this directive years ago and the Council subsequently reached a decision on it
We did not agree with the text adopted by the Council for the very simple reason that although the Commission had submitted a mandatory proposal for a visa list which we in Parliament supported the Council subsequently adopted a visa list which was effectively not mandatory at all as each Member State was allowed to introduce additional visa requirements for other states and was simply required to notify the Commission of this
The result of this was that the European Parliament brought an action concerning the directive before the European Court of Justice and ultimately won because we had not been adequately consulted
The debate in recent months since this judgment was pronounced has essentially revolved around procedural aspects namely what we are actually being consulted on the amended Council Regulation annulled by the European Court of Justice or the original Commission proposal
We subsequently reached a compromise by taking the Commission proposal as the basis for our consultation but by also giving an opinion in our new report on the proposals mentioned in the Council decision
I would like to draw attention to a key political problem on which my position as rapporteur has always coincided with the majority view in Parliament in previous debates
This is the question of Bulgaria and Romania inclusion in the list of states required to obtain a visa
In my opinion Bulgaria and Romania should be deleted from the list for two reasons firstly because discussions with the relevant Commission officials and in particular with Directorate-General Ia have shown that Romania and Bulgaria have already met some of the conditions imposed on them for the removal of the visa requirement They have not all been met but a great many have
Secondly I believe that it is time for the European Parliament to set an example
You know that in the negotiations on eastward enlargement and in the run-up to these some states felt that they had done well but there were also other Central and Eastern European countries which felt that they had come off badly
I believe that it would be good if Parliament set an example by lifting the visa requirement for Bulgarians and Romanians
I do not intend to use all my speaking time
Thank you very much for your kind attention
That completes my comments on the two reports which I am presenting to Parliament here today
Mr President on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and my group I should like to begin by pointing out something that has come to my attention
Following the approval of the Amsterdam Treaty our committee received several documents detailing the progress made in the communitarisation of issues relating to immigration asylum and refugees in addition to all the other work being carried out within the framework of the third pillar
This is something we welcome and look on as a step in the right direction
However my attention would not have been drawn to this information quite as much had it not been so easy to see that the progress made is not always consistent in terms of content and strategy
Proof of this lies in both the proposal the Commission is putting forward with regard to the entry of citizens from third countries and the other documents Parliament has recently received for example on the strategy adopted by the Council
In my opinion Parliament is not some machine designed to give out orders or amend each and every document we receive but it does have to have an overall view of events and proposals put forward by institutions in relation to this matter As a result I should like to find out what strategy the Council and Commission intend to adopt if indeed such a strategy exists and what direction we are heading in
As regards the convention as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs I should like to point out that we are aware of how important the way in which we deal with immigration is in terms of our relations with third countries I should like to make three comments in this regard
The first relates to the fact that we cannot carry out border controls alone We need the help of third countries as has clearly been demonstrated by events at Mediterranean borders and the troubles experienced there
We also believe that immigration is an important factor in codevelopment and we should help for example to provide citizens from third countries with the opportunity to study in the European Union and for account to be duly taken of this It is also something we would like to see reflected in the report
As this is closely linked to the content of the draft convention that has been proposed I have to say straight away that I feel that the rapporteur reference to the previous debate was inappropriate
I am under the impression that the report had been referred back to committee with its support and I also think that we have made an effort to continue with the debate because as I said before we think it is heading in the right direction
This is why the rapporteur comments seemed inappropriate
There are a number of things that we should like this report to avoid in particular
First it must avoid generating a climate of legal insecurity for immigrants and those wishing to enter Second it must avoid the tendency for illegal immigration which occurs because of excessive bureaucracy or bureaucratic red tape
In other words we must prevent people who could reside among us legally from being reduced to the status of sans papiers as they are known in France Nor must we be over stringent because zero immigration does not and will never exist
And in my opinion if we were to act in such a stringent manner we would be forcing these people into the hands of people traffickers
That is why we have tabled a number of amendments and reached a compromise these both represent positive steps forward on a number of important issues
As regards people who work for others we believe that entry into a country should be linked to an offer of work and in turn that the work contract should be linked to the opportunity to reside in that country or obtain a residency permit as opposed to granting entry and residency solely on the basis of a contract
To me this seems somewhat utopian
Certain countries such as Italy have already put forward imaginative proposals along these lines
As regards temporary work subsidiarity must be adhered to as the rapporteur pointed out
And as regards entry granted to people wishing to undertake independent economic activities I think it should be pointed out that countries that have quotas should be excluded from the rule provided for in the report
There are a number of points that I unfortunately do not have time to go into here but I should like to mention the fact that through the issue of family reunification we have introduced the question of exceptional cases
I should also like to stress that under no circumstances shall we accept the amendment tabled by the PPE Group which seeks to lower the age at which children have the right to family reunification to 
Lastly I should like to mention section eight
We believe that the Commission should put forward a proposal detailing the rights of immigrants living here to give them a status and regulate their legal situation
These are rights that all European citizens living here enjoy
We do not wish to create a Community with two types of citizens one with one set of rights and the other with a different set but in effect the rights citizens possess in order to be classed as a citizen in a Member State if you will excuse the repetition do not apply to immigrants We therefore believe that the Commission should put forward a proposal which includes these immigrants and resolves the issue of free movement for those legally residing here
Mr President two years ago in December the Committee on Foreign Affairs Security and Defence Policy called in the Oostlander report for the visa requirement for Romania and Bulgaria to be abolished
This position was supported by the plenary and was adopted again in a second report in March 
So Parliament has always been consistent in its view that the visa requirement for those countries should be lifted
Of course as everyone here this evening knows the requirement causes a lot of problems for people in both countries many of whom are increasingly seeking opportunities to come to the European Union for study meetings seminars exchanges of contacts and so on in the context of the enlargement process
This means that there are huge queues at the EU embassies and people face long waits often after travelling considerable distances to get there
In short it all takes a great deal of effort and is an obstacle to opportunities for direct contact
This is why we would strongly urge that the requirement should be abolished
Furthermore the countries in the leading group in other words those which have made more progress in negotiations with the European Union are now also planning to impose the same requirements as part of the adoption of the acquis communautaire so instead of becoming more integrated they are not only becoming more excluded from the Union but it is also being made more difficult for them to have contact with former eastern bloc countries
In my opinion which has the backing of the Committee on Foreign Affairs Security and Defence Policy I also draw attention to the fact that it is wrong to introduce a visa requirement for Hong Kong given that it does not apply vice versa and EU citizens are free to visit Hong Kong without a visa
It is also sending an important political signal to let it be known that the Union still regards Hong Kong as an autonomous administrative region
Mr President I am draftsman or should I say draftswoman of the opinion of the Committee on Women Rights on the initiative taken by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs which seeks to establish harmonised minimum rules that are uniformly applicable for asylum seekers not covered by the Geneva Convention
This initiative commendable in itself must not of course result in the European Union leaving its borders wide open in order to grant asylum to almost all the inhabitants of most countries throughout the world
However if we are limited to justified and necessary harmonisation my aim is to draw attention to the specific problems experienced by certain categories of refugee women whose situation is a special one in some countries
In the opinion of the Committee on Women Rights the harmonisation recommended to complement the Geneva Convention should cover special situations such as gender-specific persecution sexual violence and exploitation and trafficking in women where these put the lives and health of the women concerned at risk
Our intention is certainly not to grant asylum to all women in all countries because of women fearing sexual violence
Moreover there are also cases of this in the Member States of the Community
However where women can legitimately invoke the right to asylum in this type of special situation in their country of origin we urge in particular that they are granted a status separate from that of their husband or relatives and that they also receive special medical and psychological help All of this is along the lines of the conclusions adopted in my opinion
Madam President as you know this report has already had a remarkable history to say the least
This also accounts for why it has taken so long to reach the plenary but now at last it has arrived
The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens Rights would like to see Parliament give its support as it has recommended to the amendments such as those calling for the criteria determining who should appear on the common list black or grey or whatever you will to be the same for all countries and accessible to the public
On the other hand these initial criteria should also include provisions allowing for the list to be abolished
The list itself should be evaluated and updated on a regular basis
There is no need for it to be set in stone
The question of compulsory visas for Bulgaria and Romania has already been mentioned and the Legal Affairs Committee has delivered its opinion
This concerns the applicant countries which are still in the process of membership negotiations but which in the meantime are being discriminated against
Such a situation is unacceptable
We should also like to have sight of the reports that were compiled by the Committee of Experts who visited the respective countries and on which the visa requirement for Bulgaria and Romania has been based
We should like to see these reports laid before Parliament since it would be interesting to see on what principles they are founded
Consequently we shall give our support to Amendments Nos and amongst others
With regard to the policy on refugees which is the subject of this joint debate on behalf of the Green Group I should like to express concern over the EU refugee policy particularly in the light of the Schengen Agreement and the fact that each year fewer and fewer refugees believe that such a thing as asylum actually exists within the EU
Should we not be preventing the walls around the Union from becoming too high
The Green Group believes that a generous policy on refugees in accordance with the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees is an absolute requirement
Madam President it is unfortunately the case that asylum and immigration are politically sensitive issues particularly in the run-up to elections
It is a great pity that they are increasingly being exploited for political reasons despite the fact that many political parties have signed up to the charter against racism drawn up by the Monitoring Centre in Vienna
It is obviously very tempting to try to curry favour with the voters by exaggerating the risk that we will be overwhelmed by sweeping tides of asylum-seekers and by playing on people fears that too many foreigners will threaten our prosperity or identity
There is therefore every good reason to regulate asylum and immigration policy at European level not just in order to prevent these sorts of abuses at national level but also because of the cross-border nature of the problem
Time and time again however the Council has disappointed us here
Of course when it comes to restrictive measures defending fortress Europe and passing the problem off onto neighbouring countries it is only too happy to turn a blind eye and has no problem in finding agreement
But constructing and harmonising a humane and fair asylum and immigration policy seems to be well-nigh impossible
This is why I think it is good that the Commission and Parliament keep putting these issues back on the agenda
Mrs Lindeperg report on the harmonisation of forms of protection complementing refugee status is certainly needed now that it appears that many people are falling through the net sometimes because the Geneva Convention is interpreted too narrowly and sometimes because people do not actually meet the criteria to be classified as genuine refugees but cannot return to their country of origin
It is often claimed that the Geneva Convention is being abused that the people asking us for asylum are not genuine refugees and that the asylum problem is beset by liars and criminals
But we ourselves largely encourage this by making the Convention the only possible way of getting into Europe
This is why I particularly welcome the fact that the Commission has looked at this side of the problem and considered under what conditions the nationals of third countries can be admitted
We very much appreciate the fact that the Commission and particularly Commissioner Gradin have asked us for our opinion on this
However in order to arrive at an opinion we have had to make a sacrifice because we were only able to achieve a majority in the committee by deleting Chapter 
We can well imagine that this will come as a disappointment to the Commission as indeed it is to us because it means that the basic objective which is one that we value has been nipped in the bud
Amendment No which calls for a status to be introduced for third-country nationals is designed to counter this objection
I hope that the Commission realises that my group at least supports its idea of improving the position of illegal residents too
We are therefore hopeful that a status will be created which establishes the rights of fellow citizens from third countries
Madam President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen my own comments relate to the proposals underlying trends and amendments emanating from the left of the House
They generally have one thing in common they repeatedly support immigration from third countries and above all an extension of family immigration and reunification with an overwhelming tendency to class all forms of partnership regardless of gender as a family and at the same time adopting an increasingly wide definition of relatives
The result must be obvious
These proposals also tend to facilitate access to the labour market of the European Union
For example one amendment suggests that the mere offer of a work contract should be enough to qualify for a oneto four-year stay in the European Union
The extension of refugee status is another issue exercising our minds
I am all for thought being given to this and for seeking solutions
However we will not find any solutions based on the very vague definitions we have of the groups involved for example if when we talk about groups of people threatened with violations of fundamental human rights we insist on categorising the right to health or the right to work as basic rights or if we include groups who are threatened by major disruptions in public order or people who give homosexuality as grounds for asylum
The net is being widened somewhat too far if all these groups are to be given the status of refugees wishing to enter the European Union
If you consider the extensive new appeal arrangements which provide that an appeal always has suspensory effect for all these groups even if there has been abuse of the system then you end up with similar problems as I have already mentioned
Regarding asylum I would also like to mention that we must of course give positive signals to states such as Bulgaria or Romania who are making an effort
However I know from my own experience of the Ministry of the Interior there that there are major problems with the justice system the police and the development of border security
We know that there is a constant risk of illegal immigrants entering the Member States of the European Union via these countries
We must help them to improve their border security
However we cannot remove the visa requirement whilst Europe has no guarantee of security
The effect of all these demands tends to be an increase in immigration an invitation to abuse asylum status and an impression that we are doing too little for refugees
This effect is unacceptable and that impression totally erroneous
What we need and we in the PPE Group are arguing for this is a comprehensive solution embracing asylum and refugee issues which provides for burden sharing and for measures to counter abuse
The objective we should be setting ourselves is to help refugees but to limit and regulate immigration and to combat abuse and illegal activity so that in future we can guarantee a safe and stable Europe in the interests of our all our citizens
Madam President I should like to make four remarks in the joint debate on the Lindeperg and Lehne reports
The first concerns the appropriateness of holding the debate on the Lehne report at this time
Mr Lehne himself said in his report that we can raise the question as soon as the Amsterdam Treaty once it has entered into force provides a more appropriate framework for dealing with problems connected with the admission of third country nationals
In this case however the Commission has exercised its right of initiative for the first time by formulating a position on the subject
Parliament has repeatedly called upon the Commission to give impetus to policies which come under the third pillar and therefore cannot take a favourable decision on this
Moreover the urgent need for harmonisation in this area no longer has to be demonstrated
Secondly the admission of non-Community nationals concerns issues as important as the labour market vocational training family reunification all issues giving rise to controversy which is sometimes very acute
In short we are dealing with an extremely sensitive issue here which if the case arises provokes emotional and impassioned reactions and is also very often the cause of irrational thoughts and behaviour
Words are therefore important in themselves because of the ideas they express and the messages they convey or rather suggest
Recent events remind us that regarding nationality as an ethnic concept for example would by its very nature wake evil spirits from the past and make it possible for parties pursuing this line of approach to win elections
It is the whole political class that is being questioned about the way in which it must take up these challenges
To summarise my view regarding the admission of non-Community nationals on the territory of the European Union in particular and general relations between European citizens and non-Community nationals I would say that there is reason more than ever before to consider how the debate should be organised and how to encourage reflection and to convince the sceptics
We need to show ourselves to be understanding and sometimes patient as well as imaginative and generous towards those concerned by the policies referred to in the Lehne and Lindeperg reports
In other words two different approaches are possible
The first approach which is based on populism and electioneering tends to send out a strong message to the more fortunate members of society and a weak one to disadvantaged social groups
The second approach which consists in giving positive signals to the vulnerable groups in society and less positive ones to those who are more fortunate seems to me quite obviously to be more compatible with our duty to show solidarity as is stipulated by the Geneva Convention with regard to asylum seekers
Thirdly and I thank Mr Lehne particularly for having mentioned this aspect we should welcome Parliament coherent attitude towards maintaining visa requirements for Romanian and Bulgarian nationals
Of course the Member States will probably not follow the conclusions of Parliament which calls upon them to remove Bulgaria and Romania from the famous common list
It would be a real shame if the Council were to persevere in its attitude
However without being particularly optiministic I hope it will respond favourably to our demand
In doing so it would merely be recognising the progress achieved by both these countries
What is more it would merely be putting an end to a form of discrimination which affects two countries associated with the European Union
Finally I should like to say that the policies at the centre of our debate are part of an overall picture
I am also the first person to regret that no progress was made on burden-sharing a subject to which a previous debate was devoted
This would allow us to progress more quickly in terms of the policies we are currently discussing
Madam President once again we are dealing with the important issue of asylum and more specifically protection complementing refugee status in the European Union
However we must remind ourselves that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights a declaration that is often cited and one that is presumably adopted by all recognises the right of any person to protect themselves against persecution and to enjoy asylum in any country We must also bear in mind that the Geneva Convention without restrictive interpretations must be the frame of reference for all national or Community regulations on the right to asylum and refugee status
On the basis of the content of these texts we strongly criticise the ever more stringent conditions that Member States are imposing on persons seeking protection in countries of the Union
Entry residence and the status of persons seeking international protection in the territory of Member States cannot under any circumstances be treated merely as issues relating to the internal security of those states They must be considered with respect for international conventions and a supportive policy of aid for development and economic cooperation
In recent years we have noted with some concern that legislation on asylum has been tightened up
This has resulted in a downward trend in the number of applications for asylum in the European Union and stagnation in the rates of acknowledgement of refugee status in many countries despite the fact that the human rights situation in the world has not considerably improved
With regard to protection complementary to refugee status we support the measures put forward by the rapporteur
They focus on the protection of persons threatened by widespread violence internal conflict or violations of human rights and lay particular emphasis on the international recognition of women who are subject to sexual violence
We also believe that it is essential to adopt measures to ensure the integration of refugees into society and to help them develop as residents
Lastly I should like to highlight the case of the Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan and call on the Council to make a determined effort to intervene in this situation
Madam President human rights and citizens rights are not principles that are infinitely variable
They must be applied constantly and coherently in all countries there must be no exceptions and no grey areas
In this sense Mrs Lindeperg report endeavours to increase throughout the European Union the level of protection for refugees and persons subjected to persecution
It proposes a useful complement to measures protecting human rights
With reservation we approve the need to harmonise at EU level the rules applying to refugees who cannot claim the status afforded by the Geneva Convention but cannot return to their country of origin for fear of losing their lives or being subjected to degrading or humiliating treatment
The definition of refugee status given in the Geneva Convention is interpreted in a narrow sense by a Council decision refugee status is only granted where persecution is carried out or encouraged by the authorities
Where the authorities fail to act the persons concerned are eligible for forms of protection under national law and this is where the shoe pinches and the measure proves to be inadequate
Complementary protection can vary from one Member State to another creating to all intents and purposes disparities with regard to opportunity of protection depending on the place where the individual being persecuted makes his application for asylum
This unequal treatment can have serious consequences for example where a refugee life is at risk if he returns to his country of origin
Harmonisation is therefore desirable
Moreover it will make it possible to establish a set of rules which will provide a basis for examining the forms of protection taken from the European Convention on Human Rights
However refugees benefiting from complementary protection must not be confused with immigrants
Poverty in a country may result in severe disruptions to public order or create internal conflict
Is a person fleeing this type of disorder a refugee with the right to complementary protection or an immigrant
This is where there is the risk of confusion
Harmonisation of these forms of complementary protection must not of course be an end in itself either
We must not only pursue a policy of education by constantly denouncing human rights violations but we must also provide development aid for those countries and regions where human rights are flouted
Mrs Lindeperg report corresponds to the notion of generosity to which we are attached and proposes solutions which seek to improve the rights of persons subjected to persecution by making progress in the area of the rule of law and in this case accepted standards of behaviour in Europe
However our final vote will of course take account of possible subsequent amendments which will be tabled and adopted in plenary
Madam President at a time when in many European Union countries asylum seekers are not necessarily regarded as refugees who are to be welcomed Mrs Lindeperg report is a valuable document
She is a Member of Parliament with the courage of her convictions
Migration is a social reality in the European Union
We are concerned about the tendency in some Member States to substitute temporary so-called refuge for genuine recognition of refugee status under the Geneva Convention
The EU should not harmonise forms of protection supplementing the Geneva Convention without allowing for a liberal interpretation of the Convention on the status of refugees
For this reason we welcome the debate needed on the Austrian strategy paper on migration and asylum policy
The report makes it clear that Austria so-called strategy paper is intended as a deterrent and is not suitable as a basis for solving the problems of migration and asylum-seekers because it confuses not only the various issues surrounding their causes but also the solutions to these problems
Of course there is an urgent need for coordinated action
The objective is to create approximately equivalent admission criteria for refugees by means of a common legal protection system so that recognition criteria can be interpreted as uniformly as possible
Mrs Lindeperg report makes a valuable contribution to this
I would also like to say something about the two amendments tabled by my group
It is our view that Amendments Nos and are not relevant to this debate
A debate about the future or the fate of refugees in general is not the place for a discussion of what has happened to Mr Ocalan
That should be dealt with separately
Madam President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Lindeperg
The ARE Group has always supported her attempts to find a decent solution to the problems facing asylum-seekers and many others in this world who feel oppressed and threatened
We share her concern and we will continue to support her
We are in favour of harmonising legislation at European level in principle but we fear that it would be used as a way to consolidate fortress Europe with the legislation and the Convention being applied increasingly strictly whereas what we want is greater understanding for the huge numbers of refugees throughout the world and for all those under threat
We regret the fact that the European Parliament has been reduced to an advisory body on this issue and that we are not able to make a more decisive contribution
In our experience the Member States are the only ones that take the decisions and they are often very hypocritical about it
Very often they talk about solutions that need to be taken at European level while at the same time rejecting existing European solutions and pursuing their own restrictive policies
We are extremely unhappy that various countries are pursuing this approach and we think that the Convention should be updated to include a more modern definition of the term political refugee
We want new categories to be admitted to allow people over this very difficult hurdle
We want people persecuted for their gender or sexual orientation to be included and we want new rights for a new generation
We know that Europe cannot escape its responsibilities here and we know that we are weak when it comes to protecting democracy in the world
On the other hand we ourselves create illegality
It will always be more difficult it already is to enter Europe legally than illegally
And this causes distortions in our own society and condemns people to go through life sans papiers 
We want nothing to do with such a short-sighted policy
We want things to be regulated properly so that the problem can be brought under control
We do not want to be or to become a totalitarian state but we want to adopt a pragmatic approach in order to deal with current problems realistically
We have tabled two amendments which from what I have heard can count on considerable support
Mrs Van Lancker I am sure that there are a lot of people as well as you who agree in their hearts but we will have to wait and see if they actually vote for them
What is the point of going for a Conservative majority when we could win a more progressive majority here in the House with various representatives of the Liberals and our two groups
Madam President I have decided
I have to point out that we agree with the first Lehne report but we definitely cannot vote for the decisions in the second report where we thought the Commission text was much better than what the report says
Madam President the three reports on the crossing of EU borders which are the subject of this joint debate are very different
Two of them are the result of what is termed the intergovernmental method of negotiation they concern the draft Convention on rules for the admission of third-country nationals and the proposal for a Council regulation which was also negotiated by consensus within the Council which determines the list of countries whose nationals require a visa to enter the Union
The third text comes under a completely different category it is an own-initiative report produced by the European Parliament which proposes a wide interpretation of the refugee status laid down by the Geneva Convention
Yet just as the first two texts try to be strict on the subject of the crossing of external borders the third text clearly adopts a more liberal attitude and is inspired by ideas which it would be difficult to claim are shared by the majority of our fellow citizens
I will come back to this point in my explanation of vote
In fact it is as though this joint debate had a hidden agenda seeking to lead us to the following conclusion the intergovernmental negotiations unanimously concluded in the Council are the ones that produce the texts which are the closest to what happens in the real world
This is why for all crucial issues connected with the international movement of persons my group hopes that we stay with this method and reject the possibility of switching over to majority voting and codecision with the European Parliament as provided for by the Amsterdam Treaty
Madam President first of all let me congratulate the rapporteurs of both reports for having grappled well with exceedingly complex issues
As far as the Lindeperg report is concerned this is a very positive attempt to try to provide and encourage the provision of supplementary assistance to asylum-seekers
There is a lot to be said for trying to harmonise the social provisions which the Member States make in varying degrees and indeed for endeavouring to have a harmonised and common approach
There are some amendments which Mrs Lindeperg has already referred to which I equally would not be happy to go along with But we can end up if we accept this report essentially as it has been drafted with a very positive contribution to dealing with this issue
As far as the Lehne report is concerned I must say that here again I have some concerns it exposes the inadequacies of the convention proposals in that they are particularly restrictive in some respects but lacking in others
Not a happy set of proposals as the Lehne report explains
I basically want to talk about the report on visa requirements for third country nationals
Here I have a lot of problems and difficulties
I agree entirely with those speakers from my group who have highlighted the undesirability of introducing complex and difficult-to-operate rules relating to employment conditions and also the reduction of the age at which family members would be allowed to enter the country
The reference in the Commission proposals to the age of majority is correct and we should not introduce some other factor
But I must say and here I think I speak for the majority of British Labour Members that we really find it difficult to accept that the rights of Member States to respond to changed circumstances by introducing visa requirements should be removed
The difficult situation that we have encountered in Britain with people coming from Slovakia in the last year or so has led the British Government to introduce visa requirements which were almost unavoidable
It is premature to talk about removing visa requirements for people from Romania and Bulgaria when a number of western European countries are already receiving considerable numbers of asylum-seekers from those countries some of them with very genuine complaints
Much more needs to be done in these countries in terms of ensuring proper protection for the rights of their minorities before we can think of removing these restrictions
In all those respects I really could not accept the report as it stands and I shall be voting against those particular parts
Madam President the right of asylum is sacrosanct
That is enough said about the grand and noble principle
On no account should the right of asylum be changed in any way either in the form of a restrictive interpretation of the Geneva Convention by the Member States or through abuse of the system by interested parties
What we need on the other hand is an extension of the principles of the Geneva Convention by means of a regime providing complementary protection to deal with exceptional cases
However such an extension must in no way aid the interests of those who try to misuse the right of asylum and wish to throw the door wide open to all forms of abuse
If we are to be effective we need to find solutions which are pragmatic as well as humanitarian
We must firstly promote transparent solutions at European level and then instead of pursuing a liberal line of action seek sensible solutions which guarantee the right of asylum while preventing it from being misused
I do not think that the Member States are closing their doors to asylum seekers as is suggested in the Lindeperg report but they are rightly closing them to illegal immigrants seeking to abuse the system on economic grounds rather than on political grounds
By combating illegal and uncontrolled immigration the Member States guarantee the right of asylum and prevent our citizens from making asylum seekers outcasts
Yes to the right of asylum and complementary protection
No to lax and ideological attitudes on this serious matter
Madam President I fully endorse the Lindeperg report because it reinforces the right of asylum and provides an adequate response to the strategy paper produced by the Austrian Presidency which calls into question the international law on refugees guaranteed by the Geneva Convention
However I am opposed to the Commission draft Convention on rules for the admission of third-country nationals
In fact it proposes an admission and residence policy which conforms with the Member States most restrictive rules
This is particularly true in the case of employment since it makes national and Community preference one of the key principles of the admission policy
Was the Commission never informed of the OECD study in which it is acknowledged that there is no close correlation between the influx of foreigners into a country and the increase in the unemployment rate
I nevertheless admit that the adoption of certain amendments has made a significant improvement to the draft
However I am dismayed at the compromise amendment proposed by the PSEPPE to Article on employment
This amendment not only implies acceptance of the notion of national preference but it clearly vindicates the system of quotas which would allow each Member State to take from poor countries the manpower and qualified workers it needs
My group has therefore tabled an amendment to correct what I had hoped was only a mistake until I heard Mrs Terrón i Cusí speech
My group final vote will depend on acceptance of this amendment and I will be requesting a roll-call vote
The Commission draft convention does not augur well for the substance of future Community immigration and asylum policy as provided for by the Amsterdam Treaty
We must warn the organisations of the dangers of this and take action with them to transform the present stumbling blocks into proper reception conditions
I am taking pains to do this
I reject this notion of a fortress Europe which is inward-looking
We must put an end to this scapegoat strategy which the Minister of the Interior Mr Schily also talked about a fortnight ago in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs
However our French Minister is no better on this subject
He has never addressed the issue of immigrants in terms of the legal implications
He has consistently linked immigration with unemployment insecurity and criminality as if evil always comes from elsewhere
The danger of this type of xenophobia it cannot be called anything other than this is great for as Gorki wrote it is preferable to expect the best of man expecting the worst will only lead him astray
Madam President Mr Lehne report gives me the opportunity once more to denounce the excesses of Europe emigrationism 
Immigration policy is and must remain the responsibility of each Member State
I reject the outright harmonisation of immigration policies the right of asylum and criminal and judicial procedures that is advocated by Brussels
A healthy state is first and foremost a state which controls its influx of immigrants and makes it possible for its nationals to work and go out in the evening in complete safety
We will vote against this report which protects non-Community nationals and damages the interests of European nationals and which encourages family reunification even where a family unit is not legitimate or recognised as such in the eyes of the law since it talks about partners
What is more we want to offer jobs to foreigners when seven million people in our own country are unemployed or live below the poverty line
I would point out that according to this report a contract of employment will be sufficient to obtain refugee status
If adopted these various amendments will undoubtedly turn our Europe which is already an open door when it comes to immigration into a Europe where the floodgates are opened to what will become a spate of immigrants
Some Members of Parliament talk to us about populism electioneering and racism
But they do not live in the so-called problem areas
It is the poorest and weakest people who put up with this type of situation and this can no longer be tolerated
It is unthinkable that those who advocate jobs and security in Europe could support such initiatives which are destructive to our countries and people
I for my part will not do so
Allow me to remind you of the famous words of one of our colleagues who said that we cannot take all the troubles of the world upon our shoulders
Madam President ladies and gentlemen I am pleased that most of us in this House are not of the same opinion as Mrs Stirbois thank goodness and that the majority of us see refugees in a different light
I confess that I am now finding it difficult to keep to the subject I had actually planned to speak about that is Mr Lehne report on visa policy
We have been discussing this subject ever since I have been in Parliament
Our discussions on how to formulate arrangements giving people from third countries legal access to the European Union spanned the whole of the previous legislature
The judgment of the European Court of Justice as Mr Lehne has already said Parliament took this to court still failed to clarify the degree of consistency we should apply to this question
My group has also taken the line that if we want to retain our credibility we should give our opinion on both the Council and Commission proposals
But as we have found ourselves in a state of deadlock with the forthcoming ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam we expect that once it has been ratified and the Treaty has come into force the Commission will submit the new proposal it has announced without delay and that the amendments from Parliament that we are voting on tomorrow will appear in the new proposal
Nevertheless I agree with the rapporteur that the procedure for granting visas should comply with the same requirements and procedures in all the Members States
The fact that there is a visa requirement for certain third-country nationals does not mean that the relevant procedures should be unjust or even discriminatory
Yet that is very often the case at present
People who need a visa for relatives or business visitors or for youth and student exchanges should be given clear information on the documents required and the time taken to issue a visa when they submit an application
We know all too well that waiting times of six months are frequent with all the costs that implies
The authorities in the Members States should have to observe clear guidelines in this area to make the process both transparent and humane
Article in fact requires uniform conditions and procedures in this field
We also hope that incorporating the Schengen Agreement into the Treaty will at last make it possible to draw up a single European list of third countries whose nationals require a visa for travel into the EU
Many members of my group also believe that both Romania and Bulgaria should be deleted from the list something Parliament has indeed been advocating for the last four and a half years
It cannot be right that countries with whom we have association agreements are still at a disadvantage and are still on this list
I often go to Romania and Bulgaria myself
When you see how things are going there you are bound to conclude that this needs to be changed because both these countries have already made great efforts 
The President cut the speaker off
Madam President even though the two Lehne reports are extremely important I am only going to refer to the Lindeperg report as it would be impossible to talk about all of them in the two minutes I have available
I should firstly like to welcome and thank the rapporteur for demonstrating her ability for dialogue and for constantly seeking solutions
Of course when such solutions have not been forthcoming she has sought to point out discrepancies in a way that I consider to be very constructive
The rapporteur is aware that many of us and in my view a broad majority in the House agree with her objectives
As she points out these complementary schemes of protection must be harmonised so that those who genuinely merit a specific form of protection but who do not meet the conditions laid down in the Geneva Convention can receive it
Therefore we must not lower ourselves to the level of popularity-seeking because this is ultimately the worst enemy of those who are or who should be allowed to enter under the terms of the Geneva Convention and those for whom complementary forms of protection must be found
The two amendments tabled by the ARE Group which Mrs Lindeperg wanted to accept and which I hope she does not accept are a clear example of this
I hope they will be rejected because they are really the epitome of what Parliament is not able to do
Whether we like it or not the Geneva Convention says what it says and Mrs Lindeperg there are other people who are qualified to interpret it apart from the United Nations High Commissioner including the Member States high courts
However this is something that appears to have been overlooked
We obviously cannot try to change the Geneva Convention and say that it protects homosexuals That would be impossible because in order to change the Geneva Convention we must use all the traditional instruments of international law
And were we to do this in short we would merely be prejudicing those groups and potentially even homosexual groups in need of adequate protection protection that is not provided for in the Geneva Convention Indeed the complementary measures we are currently seeking are in fact aimed at those groups
Madam President Commissioners I should like to begin by saying something about the Convention on rules for the admission of third-country nationals
Mr Lehne report and the Commission proposal are extremely important elements of what should become a common immigration policy
A European approach is particularly important here because the differences that currently exist between the Member States undermine not only the free movement of persons as Mr Lehne said but also in my view the rights that we grant to immigrants
This is why a European approach is so important
I must admit that the view that Parliament is putting forward today does not exactly fill me with enthusiasm
Even here in the House there is not a majority in favour of opening the door a little wider for further immigration
Of course I realise that this is a highly sensitive issue with its connotations of unemployment and social exclusion
But the main point is that there are still people even here in the Chamber who constantly manage to present immigration as a threat and as something that will inevitably bring an increase in crime thus encouraging xenophobia and making the whole issue taboo
I hope that some day the majority will support the view that migrants not only need Europe but also that Europe needs migrants if only for the sake of our own labour market and demographic development
It is important to have this report because these proposals ensure that European harmonisation will not be harmonisation downwards
The references to quotas and measures deliberately allow those Member States which have a broader policy the scope to implement it
We are not defending quotas as such but as some countries already have them it is important for us to support them
This also guarantees that families have the right to be reunited
We must learn to accept that people do not migrate temporarily these are men women and children who are entitled to a family life
I would like to say a few words about the report by Mrs Lindeperg on which I congratulate her
I am particularly pleased that there is broad support for this report in the House at long last as an additional status is absolutely necessary
Many countries such as Belgium only have a tolerance status with complementary forms of protection and this has particularly damaging consequences
It causes uncertainty for the refugees in question and uncertainty for society because having residents with no rights in an insecure position is not good for any society
So we really need an additional status in Europe
All I would add is that in December the Council of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs put these two important issues that we are discussing today on the agenda for the forthcoming legislative period but with such an unreasonable deadline that there is a danger that it could become a long-term project or even be shelved altogether
So I think it is particularly important that Parliament should today send a political signal to the Commission and via the Commission to the Council that we in the House want to tackle these two sensitive and difficult issues and I hope that this will then lead to a clear signal being given not in five years not in twenty years but at the Tampere summit that we need solutions to them
Madam President ladies and gentlemen many speeches on asylum and refugees in Europe remind me of Bertold Brecht famous play The Good Woman of Szechuan in which the main character has to work hard at night as a realist to put right the damage she has done as a philanthropist during the day
We are being urged to drop the visa requirement for Romania and Bulgaria yet any security specialist can show that this would promote organised crime traffic in human beings and drug smuggling
Where does that leave our concern for our citizens security
Here in Europe we quite rightly accept refugees and people facing political persecution
There is no dispute about that as every right-minded person knows
However there are also numerous economic refugees who can neither come here nor remain here permanently and now Mrs Lindeperg is proposing that we should accept everyone coming from countries where there is widespread violence internal conflict or other circumstances which have severely disrupted public order
My dear Mrs Lindeperg this definition applies to three quarters of Africa and half of Asia
So provision is to be made for measures to ensure that all these people are integrated into social and economic life not forgetting that we have million unemployed in Europe and at the same time if they are rejected they can lodge an appeal with suspensory effect
Mrs Lindeperg that may well earn our respect and you may deserve our sympathy but it will not win our vote for your report
It is high time we limited immigration into Europe
Only then will we have a chance of integrating those who already live here and that should be our priority
Mr President firstly I should like to congratulate the two rapporteurs Mr Lehne and Mrs Lindeperg on the enormous amount of work they have put into the three reports we are discussing jointly this evening
I can support Mrs Lindeperg report without hesitation
It must be sensible when subsidiary protection issues will be an area of growing importance for the EU for Member States to operate similar procedures and a similar level of social provision for all refugees
With respect to Mr Lehne report on the admission of third country nationals one can only share the report view that the draft convention is unbalanced with unnecessary rigidity in many areas and with unworkable elements in others
However despite my acknowledgement of Mr Lehne hard work I have some problems with his report on visas for third country nationals
The main areas of difficulty are firstly the fact of his adding to the visa-required list a visa-exempt list secondly the ruling-out of Member States right to impose national visa regimes in certain circumstances like those we have experienced in the United Kingdom recently thirdly while I acknowledge the progress made by the Bulgarian and Romanian authorities in combating illegal immigration the reality is that significant numbers of Romanian and Bulgarian nationals continue to make poorly-founded claims for asylum in Member States of the European Union
Despite this however I intend to support the report primarily because I completely endorse the rapporteur view that visas should be not be required for individuals who hold residence permits in any state in the Union
As long as he continues to press the point that residents of the European Union should have the same rights and same duties as citizens I have to be in favour of this report
Madam President Mr Lehne and the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs have spent a great deal of time familiarising themselves with the Commission proposal relating to the Convention on rules of admission and I appreciate their efforts
I have followed with particular interest the various twists and turns of the committee deliberations
Numerous demands have been made many of which touch on one or two issues that are absolutely central to the proposal It is those that I should now like to comment on
The first concerns family reunification which is a fundamental right laid down in international law
The Member States of the Union through international agreements have established the importance of the family for the welfare and well-being of the individual
This bodes well for agreement on a common line to be followed but as ever the question is how far should we go
The concept of family varies from one Member State to another and the same applies to age limits
In both instances my proposal means a step towards a closer approximation within the Union
The discussions in the Council of Ministers will show whether there is scope to advance our positions further which the Commission naturally welcomes
Secondly integration requires stability and a long-term perspective
The objective must be that immigrants are able to live under the same conditions as those enjoyed by European citizens a vision that should run through all the policy initiatives on immigrants
Consequently our proposal also addresses the question of the rights to be offered to Europe immigrants
In this respect my first thoughts are focused on the nationals of third countries who have lived legally in Europe for many years
In the proposal we have identified the following basic areas in which we think our citizens and immigrants should receive the same treatment access to the labour market and freedom to pursue an activity as a self-employed person basic education vocational training trade union rights freedom of association and access to the housing market and social assistance
We have also taken up the question of freedom of movement for nationals of third countries
For example it would be reasonable for permanently domiciled immigrants to apply for jobs that are not filled in other Member States
The alternative is a segregated Europe with all the attendant problems of discrimination social tension and instability
As one might expect the views in the Council of Ministers differ widely on this issue
Consequently I had hoped to be able to count on a clear expression of support from the European Parliament
Now it seems as though this is not to be which is deeply disappointing
Nevertheless I have no intention of withdrawing the Convention
The underlying causes of current migration are largely unchanged
People are looking for a better life for themselves or their children
There are no longer any uninhabited continents and migrants therefore look for places which they can physically reach
Europe will continue to be an attractive destination a state of affairs we should accept as permanent and normal instead of regarding it as a passing and somewhat dramatic occurrence
Furthermore a strategy for a common policy on migration is a natural consequence of integration and the idea that similar social and economic conditions should prevail throughout Europe with no one being left behind
I would assume that the ideas contained in the Lehne report will be taken into account in the forthcoming negotiations
Naturally the Commission will do its best to ensure that progress is made
Mrs Lindeperg in her report addresses the issue of protection for people who flee their homes but do not fulfil the requirements laid down in the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees what we sometimes call supplementary forms of international protection
The rapporteur urges the Commission to begin work at the earliest opportunity on harmonisation of the European Union asylum policies
I am sure the House will be pleased to learn that this work is already in hand
As a beginning I have put forward a proposal for a directive on asylum procedures within the Union
At the request of the German Presidency I will soon be submitting a working document on the subject
The aim is to begin discussions on the points at issue as early as the spring
Secondly we have now begun work on adapting the Commission proposals on temporary protection and burden-sharing to meet the requirements of the new Treaty
As you know we have been putting in a great deal of hard work on this since the Commission submitted its original proposal in 
The issue will be discussed for the third time at ministerial level during the informal meeting of the Council in Berlin at the end of the week
But despite all this the Member States are still a long way from reaching a decision
If there is no agreement by the time the new Treaty enters into force we shall have no alternative but to submit entirely new instruments
In my view this is what will happen
Thirdly the adaptation of the Eurodac Convention is another major task
Last December the Council of Ministers decided to freeze work on Eurodac wishing to wait until the Amsterdam Treaty had entered into force before further negotiations
During the meeting the Commission was also asked to submit a new proposal in the form of a regulation
Such an adaptation of Eurodac will mean a great deal of work and it goes without saying that it should begin immediately
The work on this area alone will take up much of the time between now and next June
In the longer term the new Treaty stipulates minimum standards for supplementary protection
This is in fact mentioned as a key point in the action plan on freedom security and justice which the Council approved on December
Asylum policy in general and supplementary protection in particular will accordingly be the focus of considerable attention during the coming years
Consequently the Lindeperg report makes a welcome and constructive contribution to the discussion on the future direction of asylum policy in Europe
Madam President my thanks to Mr Lehne for his excellent report
This consultation of the European Parliament completes the process that began with the annulment by the Court of Justice in June of Regulation No laying down the list of third countries whose citizens had to be in possession of a visa
We need first to put this into context
The regulation that was annulled was based on Article c of the Maastricht Treaty
According to that article Community jurisdiction in relation to visas is limited firstly to determining the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders and secondly the introduction of a uniform format for visas
If it has to be adopted before the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam the new regulation will be adopted by the Council again on the basis on Article c
That circumstance which cannot be avoided makes matters still more complex
This tricky situation has been well depicted by Mr Lehne and some of your amendments reflect this
My view is dictated by the evolving legislative context
I wish also to draw attention to the prospect of incorporating into the Union the progress achieved through the Schengen Agreement and its consequences for visa policy
I turn now to the amendments which I shall separate into two categories first of all there are many amendments based on the evolving legislative framework that I have just described and which I would roughly classify as anticipatory amendments Amendment No concerning the title describes the regulation as provisional
Amendments Nos and relating to the recitals include a number of references to changes that will be introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam
But when we look at the actual articles of the regulation the amendments I have described as anticipatory are incompatible with the provisions of the current Article c Let me cite to you by way of example Amendments Nos and concerning the various aspects of visa issue an area that is not at the moment and I stress for the moment an area of Community responsibility
In these circumstances it is not legally possible for the Commission to accept those amendments which anticipate an area of Community jurisdiction that will not exist until the Treaty of Amsterdam enters into force
Secondly the European Parliament is proposing a number of amendments that fall perfectly within the scope of Article c these respect the parameters of that article but we do have to consider them paradoxical though this may seem in the light of the forthcoming entry into force of Amsterdam
I can explain this better by taking as an example Amendment No concerning the criteria for determining which countries will be subject to the visa requirement
The way in which this issue is dealt with viewed in terms of the existing Article c will be significantly different once Article of the Treaty of Amsterdam has given the Community the additional authority to draw up the list of countries whose citizens will not be required to be in possession of a visa
The prospects for achieving total harmonisation of visa policy something which Parliament wants moreover therefore mean that we have to look again at the issue wearing our Amsterdam-tinted spectacles so to speak
I do not however wish to be absolutely negative about the possibility of accepting the amendments Parliament is proposing as part of the new consultation on the following regulation
The prospect of the now imminent entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty will bring about profound changes with regard to visas new powers will be transferred to the Community in relation to the measures to be adopted in these sectors
The Treaty of Amsterdam has set definite time-limits while the recent Commission and Council action plan on the area of freedom security and justice actually provides for more rapid adoption of some visa-related measures
The Community must shoulder the obligations its new powers bring with them and the Commission will have to assume its own responsibilities without delay
I can assure you that the work Parliament has done as part of this new consultation will not have been in vain
I am also certain that some of the proposed amendments will be largely taken into consideration in the new proposal for a regulation that the Commission has included in its own programme of work on which Parliament has recently delivered its opinion
I shall conclude Madam President with a reference to the question that has been raised concerning Bulgaria and Romania
The inclusion of a third country on the common list of countries whose citizens have to have a visa is based on an assessment of the main criteria involving the risks to security and the threat of illegal immigration
Having said that the assessment made at the time the regulation is adopted is not set in stone
And with that in mind the Community and Bulgaria and Romania have on several occasions in recent months had the opportunity of discussing this problem which has a variety of implications
From those various contacts through the association councils at ministerial level and through correspondence it has become apparent that Bulgaria and Romania are making considerable efforts not least with the help of the Union and supported by the PHARE programme in a whole range of important areas with a view to the decision that will have to be taken on their inclusion in the common list
Without entering into detail I would just mention the strengthening of controls at external frontiers the conclusion of readmission agreements with other states security of travel documents the fight against crime and so on
The progress that has been made is I assure you being closely monitored thanks to the presence of experts in the field
The view of the European Parliament will probably be a decisive factor as far as the Commission is concerned at the proper time once the Amsterdam Treaty has entered into force
Thank you for that speech Mr Monti and for the explanations you have given to the House
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon
Classification packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations
The next item is the recommendation for second reading A on behalf of the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Consumer Protection on the common position adopted by the Council CCOD with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive concerning the approximation of the laws regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations Rapporteur Mrs Baldi
Madam President it is once again time for us to discuss important health and environmental questions at an hour that is scarcely popular either with those responsible for the report or us who are involved in the debate
It is a remarkable coincidence that in Strasbourg environmental work always seems to take place on Tuesday nights
In every other way the report we are discussing tonight is very important
It concerns many citizens of the European Union since it deals with the classification and labelling of dangerous preparations
The topic is particularly relevant for Finland Sweden and Austria for whom the problem of regulating chemicals was a matter of concern in their membership negotiations
Transitional arrangements were made for all three countries allowing them to retain for a time their own legislation on chemical preparations which was more stringent than that in force in the Union
I have to admit that I had serious misgivings during the first reading of the directive
The position adopted by the rapporteur and then by the Commission was in my view far too lenient bearing in mind the dangers associated with chemicals
Consequently we had a fairly intensive discussion on the subject at first reading and as a result the outcome now looks quite promising
Many of the earlier amendments have considerably sharpened up the wording of the document thereby bringing into focus the health aspects for European citizens
It is particularly important from the point of view of those people who have to work with these types of chemical preparations every day
The obligation to provide safety data sheets means that information is available both on the components of the preparations and on how they should be handled
It is essential that everyone has access to these data sheets regardless of the size of the enterprise everyone is entitled to a safe working environment
Classification and labelling should not only be carried out where the danger is apparent or life-threatening but also where the preparations are allergy-forming cause irritation or are harmful to the environment
In other words the rapporteur has done a good job and deserves to be congratulated
The classification of preparations is not an easy subject to discuss but Mrs Baldi has certainly succeeded
Nevertheless I should just like to bring up a minor point if I may
Even though it was agreed in committee I cannot really see the point of Amendment No 
Perhaps we are only further complicating a matter which should really have left Parliament as quickly as possible once a decision had been reached
But the card has been played and now it is up to the Commission to make a move
For the future let us hope that many more alternatives are found to replace these dangerous preparations so that we can be spared having to discuss how they are to be regulated and concentrate on finding substitutes instead
None of these preparations can be said to enhance either the environment or people health in the long term
We must therefore begin by doing our best to find suitable substitutes
Madam President the title of this debate is so boring that many people must believe it makes no difference
But behind the words packaging classification and labelling of dangerous preparations there are some important rules for the environment and above all for the working environment
In practical terms the common position means that painters will now have information about what they are working with
From July volatile organic solvents will be labelled for their narcotic effects
You may ask yourselves whether this kind of information ought not to be a human right
The improper use of organic solvents was already causing problems years ago
In Denmark we call it the painter syndrome
Now we are going to get the safety data sheets for which Denmark has been campaigning for many years
We have finally silenced the oil industry which tried to block the directive with every means at its disposal
The idea that painters are less intelligent than other people has been dispelled for ever and can in future only be used in history books as an example of how a debate can sometimes degenerate for economic reasons
It should be clear to everyone that the EU is developing in the right direction and that the working environment and public health are now being improved which is the only way to go if the EU project is to have public support
We will now continue the good work of gaining recognition of the long-term effects of solvents on the sense of balance hearing and sight and explaining the effects of hormone-like chemicals
Chemicals are still on our agenda in the EU
Madam President on behalf of the Commission I should like to congratulate Mrs Baldi on a very worthwhile effort
There has been excellent cooperation on this highly technical proposal
Thank goodness we have finally reached the last stage before adoption
The proposal particularly concerns Finland Sweden and Austria and it offers an acceptable solution to the difficulties they experienced over their existing legislation on the products in question and pesticides in their membership negotiations
As we know this led to temporary transitional arrangements for those countries
At first reading the European Parliament supported the proposal underlying principles
At the same time Parliament had to decide on the amendments which were also adopted
The Commission was able to include the majority of these in the common position and the discussions in the Council also produced results
In the Commission view the common position adopted by the Council meets both the objectives laid down in Article a of the Treaty namely the establishment and functioning of the internal market and a high level of protection
Furthermore the proposal also takes account of the needs of new Member States
Consequently the Commission is endeavouring to ensure prompt adoption of the directive
Now at second reading Parliament has tabled three amendments all of which the Commission supports
The first aims to change the committee procedure from type b to type a which marks a return to the Commission original proposal
It so happens that this was the position we adopted in the Council but it was unanimously voted down
We still think that this amendment would make it easier to carry through the directive
The second amendment which we also accept is intended to clarify and improve a particular provision
The third amendment which the Commission had already approved at first reading was as you know rejected by the Council so we would like to retable this amendment as well
The Commission warmly welcomes the practical approach adopted by Parliament in only submitting three amendments at this reading
As I have already said the Commission finds all three acceptable
Naturally I hope the Council will also give its approval so that we can avoid conciliation
It is now up to Parliament and the Council of Ministers to make a decision
Thank you Mrs Gradin
I am also sorry Mrs Hulthén that there are not more Members here to follow the debate on this very important report but that is how things are
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon
The sitting was closed at am
Approval of the Minutes
The Minutes of yesterday sitting have been distributed
Are there any comments
Mr President on a point of order under Rule Code of conduct
Last month Parliament rightly demanded openness and transparency with respect to the Commission yet Parliament at the moment is being hypocritical in respect of its own openness and transparency
What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander
Rule and Annex I Article indicate that declarations of Members interests should be available to the public
At the moment the register is only available in the three working places Luxembourg Brussels and Strasbourg
It is very difficult for me to defend that when I receive questions in my constituency
If someone wants to look at the register they have to travel abroad
Mr President I should like to ask you whether you will give an interpretation of the Rules to say that available to the public means that it should be available in Parliament information offices
If you are not prepared to do that will you refer the matter to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure the Verification of Credentials and Immunities because as a member of that committee you are very well aware that it was the clear intention of the committee that available to the public should mean in each Member State
Mr Ford I will check the matter you have raised
In fact there was an amendment asking for the register to be made available in every Member State but Parliament rejected it
I cannot give an interpretation against what was clearly the will of the House at that moment
I will refer the matter to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure the Verification of Credentials and Immunities as you request so that it can submit the appropriate proposal if necessary
In which case it would be necessary to translate the declarations from Members which at present are only available in their original languages
Mr President you will remember that I raised that very issue last week in the Conference of Presidents
I suggested that given our insistence that the Commission is more open there is a very simple way in which we can be in the vanguard of actually demonstrating transparency on this issue and that is by attaching the declaration of Members interests to each Member particular entry on Parliament website
That would immediately demonstrate to everybody that we were both transparent and prepared in the public interest to put our record completely publicly on the website
Mrs Green I agree but I cannot give an interpretation on a very sensitive matter contrary to what was decided
It was not decided that these declarations would be public the House decided to make them available to the public
The Committee on the Rules of Procedure the Verification of Credentials and Immunities could make this proposal and if it obtained the necessary majority that would be excellent and it could be put before the House for ratification
This would be better and everyone then would have full knowledge of the proposal which personally I have nothing against
Mr President we all received your letter saying that the Bureau has decided to alter Parliament information strategy
From now on ten or twelve subjects of interest will be selected from the week part-session which Parliament press service section will publish
At present we have a daily report giving information on the previous afternoon sitting
Today report focuses on Mr Barzanti report which is most definitely of interest as far as the issue of information is concerned
I am worried what the impact on Parliament profile will be if only ten or twelve subjects of interest are selected from the week part-session
How for example will voluntary institutions acquire information on issues the press are not necessarily reporting and which are not necessarily the main news stories of the day
I am rather worried about this and I will be writing to you on the matter Mr President I would like a reassurance that this change with regard to Parliament press service will not lead to a situation where citizens are deprived of information on the work of Parliament
Mrs Ojala the Bureau took this decision after studying Parliament information policy It takes the view that if Parliament details everything that has been debated in the House then ultimately of course nothing will be publicised because the newspapers cannot publicise or different issues
If we want the media to make the public aware of the work we are doing we naturally need to select those issues that might be of most interest to them
This is a purely technical problem involving communication and the transfer of information
At the same time the Rainbow will be available much more quickly so that everyone can read it as soon as possible
Mr President we should spare a thought this morning for the victims of yesterday avalanche in the Chamonix valley which swept away around chalets
In this winter holiday period this incident should serve to remind us that the mountains form a specific area which rarely gives the European Union cause for concern
I propose that this issue be included in the topical and urgent debate during the part-session in March in the context of natural disasters
In the meantime we should send the victims and their families a message of support
Thank you Mrs Leperre-Verrier
I shall of course be sending Parliament condolences to the families concerned
Mr President this morning Parliament was besieged by police officers and others and I have read in the press that Parliament will suffer another round of sieges this time by farmers especially from the Alsace region
I wanted to ask you whether you could inform us what has brought this on what is happening and whether you have already had requests from the farmers that they should be received
It is clear that they wish to submit requests through the Members of this House and that they are not simply surrounding Parliament for the good of their health
It would be interesting if we had a briefing on this matter as farming is going through a critical phase and we have debated these problems on several occasions both last week and this
Mr Ephremidis it would seem that they are not going to perform any gymnastics because they are coming on tractors
Nevertheless President Santer Commissioner Fischler Mr Colino chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and myself are going to meet them to find out what exactly their demands are
Mr President I should also like to know what the European Parliament is planning to do about today demonstration
It is important that we make an effort to listen to the demands of European farmers and that we have a delegation ready to meet them when they arrive
I think the actions I have proposed would be effective
It would be a constructive move to meet the farmers who are here and to answer their questions when they arrive at the European Parliament
Mr Lindqvist I would remind you that Parliament does not have any forces to maintain public order That is a matter for the French police here
We have therefore naturally taken no measures in this respect
I would ask you all to let the matter rest now that we have given you information on this issue since there is nothing to be gained from discussing it any further
Mr President on the subject of Article and natural disasters such as snow and farmers I would draw your attention to the fact that yesterday in the Netherlands a country kilometres long we had tailbacks totalling kilometres
That is three times the length of our country with the result that nobody could get in or out
Could we not at some time Mr President discuss road pricing and how to relieve road congestion in Europe under the topical and urgent procedure
Mr Wijsenbeek I am sure you are well aware of the procedure for topical and urgent debates
If you believe that this matter is urgent you should ask for it to be included in a forthcoming debate
Mr President I should like to ask for your advice
Yesterday I had a question down to the Commission and today I have a similar one to the Council
In fact it was so far down on the list that naturally it was not taken
This morning I received the reply to my question and it was the greatest fudge and cowardly reply I have ever heard from the Commission
Mr President what recourse have we in this Parliament to such cowardly responses to serious questions
My question concerned the absolute destruction caused by the seals in the North Atlantic fisheries
It has now been conclusively proven scientifically and yet we here in the European Union are not capable nor even have the courage 
Mr Killilea I do not know what we can do
However what we cannot do is to go into the issue now as this is not the appropriate occasion
Mr President I find it interesting that Mr Killilea quotes scientific evidence
However on another issue I should like to know under what criteria you agree to meet certain demonstrators who come here to Strasbourg
Do you take into account farmers on the periphery of Europe Ireland Greece Spain or wherever who cannot get here
Under what criteria do you meet people
People in close proximity can come other people cannot
Mrs McKenna what you are saying reminds me of an anecdote
Once after a demonstration had been announced a Spanish minister for the interior said to the British ambassador Do you want us to send more police
The British ambassador replied No send me fewer demonstrators
Laughter
I do not think that Parliament is providing demonstrators or organising the demonstration
Therefore I cannot answer your question
Before moving on to the objections concerning the topical and urgent debate I should like to congratulate our colleague Mr Menrad who is celebrating his sixtieth birthday
We hope he celebrates many more years with us
Applause
The Minutes were approved
EMU and enlargement
The next item is the report A by Mr Barros Moura on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs on constitutional consequences of EMU in the context of enlargement
Mr President ladies and gentlemen this report takes as its starting point the undeniable success of the adoption of the single currency after a rigorously applied convergence process
The achievement of Economic and Monetary Union with an independent European Central Bank is a quantum leap for the European Union leading to the emergence of a genuine supranational political authority with responsibilities in matters of monetary and exchange-rate policies that once belonged to the sovereign States
However the institutional establishment of Economic and Monetary Union has been unbalanced in that the power to centrally manage monetary policy is not matched by any real powers for the Union to effectively coordinate economic policies by means of broad guidelines or any binding multilateral surveillance
At the same time the inadequacy of the Union arrangements for ensuring transparency and democratic accountability in the activity of the European Central Bank has become apparent
In order to deal with these problems my report recommends two approaches one is to explore in depth the opportunities offered by the existing Treaties in particular through the interinstitutional agreement already proposed by the European Parliament and the other is to reform the Treaties now that the successful introduction of the euro has eliminated the risk that starting the review process might jeopardise EMU itself the famous Pandora box theory
The current situation that of a common monetary authority without matching political authority highlights the Union democratic deficit and also conflicts with national economic and social policies where a possible clash with centralised monetary policy could undermine that rigorous centralised policy as regards the need to safeguard the overriding aim of maintaining price stability
However we should also be seeking to guarantee all of the European Union policies including job creation and fighting unemployment at the same level
The report therefore recommends that EMU should be accompanied by effective means of establishing and guaranteeing coordinated economic policies in Europe so as to promote solidarity economic and social cohesion and equal opportunities among all citizens of the Member States
This calls for a constitutional framework the only elements of which I should like to highlight for the time being are an Economic and Social Union as a counterweight to Economic and Monetary Union and a new social contract to underpin intra-European solidarity This should involve a minimum of social harmonisation labour legislation social security combating social exclusion and creating jobs
The proposals on Monetary Union are intended to guarantee the independence of the European Central Bank while strengthening its democratic accountability
The proposals on Economic Union are essentially intended to guarantee effective coordination and coherence between the Union economic policies and those of the Member States by means of a set of binding policy mix policies
For that purpose given the shortcomings of the Stability Pact the recommendation will have to be replaced by a decision on the annual preparation of the broad economic policy guidelines and the multilateral surveillance of their application
As far as the institutions are concerned the report calls for Parliament monitoring and codecision roles to be reinforced in all areas of EMU
It also recommends strengthening the initiative-taking and political impetus of the Commission whose political accountability would also be improved in that way
It further calls for improved coordination of the Council work so as to give macroeconomic regulation priority over the tendency to centralise all powers in ECOFIN
And it recommends monitoring the formal economic coordination carried out by the EuroCouncil by means of legitimate democratic machinery and participation by national parliaments in monitoring EMU
As far as EMU external representation is concerned the report recommends speaking with one voice to be decided upon jointly by the Council Commission and European Central Bank according to their respective powers in international financial bodies like the IMF or G-
The aim will be to use the power conferred by the euro a monetary unit that may even challenge the supremacy of the dollar to economically regulate globalisation in such as way as to promote justice and to challenge the hegemony of the USA
Finally I should like to refer to the proposals for new European policies which according to the report are vital in view of the introduction of EMU
These are a guarantee that employment will be the Union top economic priority harmonisation of taxes a social policy promoting and safeguarding the European social model and a federal-type budget that promotes economic and social cohesion and helps us to tackle crises or asymmetrical shocks in one or more Member States
We do not intend to call EMU into question but we want this quantum leap forward to be mirrored by corresponding democratic progress in the political economic and social fields
Mr President ladies and gentlemen given the lack of time I will mention just three issues the coordination of national economic policies the legal framework for supervision and the external representation of the monetary union
On the first issue the current situation is unsatisfactory
This is because we were told in Amsterdam not to touch the monetary union title for fear that this would open Pandora box from which anything could emerge
This was just a pretext to hide the disquiet uncertainty and lack of conviction of many governments
However this problem which was pushed under the carpet then is now reappearing
We have one monetary policy for different economic policies
Clearly we should try to balance this situation from an operational and functional point of view but this is not being achieved
We were told that recommendations would be made represented by the infamous broad economic policy guidelines
However we realised straightaway that these guidelines were a disaster
This was because the representatives of the national administrations and national finance departments all decided to maintain the status quo and refrain from any criticism of the policies conducted by their respective countries
The result was that these guidelines have been reduced to formulaic and generalised declarations of principle which commit no-one
This approach was therefore a failure and has resulted in the development of totally divergent and uncoordinated economic policies
This situation should be viewed in terms of the striking contrast between the US economy which is bursting with health and the languid European economy
Since the triumphant introduction of the euro reality in the shape of inadequate national economic policies has reestablished its grip
I do not want to cause a political controversy but we must recognise that the fact these problems have not been resolved just because once again the majority of those in power are Socialists
The second issue involves the legal framework for supervision
There is not yet sufficient awareness in political circles of the enormous changes that the international financial markets have experienced
Politicians believe that the current system in which each country organises its own banking supervision is adequate
But times are changing
The Internet and globalisation are now prevalent and the instruments for supervising these financial markets are clearly inadequate even at European level
An extraordinary transformation is therefore needed mentally and culturally to cope with this
Clearly the current situation in Europe is unsatisfactory and it must change
I am not alone in thinking this as reasonable and moderate people like Mr Lamfalussy also share this view
I cannot go into detail on this issue due to lack of time Also I want to briefly mention the third issue of external representation
We have seen the results of this

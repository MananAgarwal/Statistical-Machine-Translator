What is really at stake here is not protecting copyright that is already guaranteed by Article of the directive but maintaining the current state of freedom of access to the Internet for everyone and not just the big boys
The requirement for technical copies to be authorised adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens Rights would actually have the effect of extending to the digital sphere the dominance which the multinationals already enjoy over the way in which music is conventionally distributed
We therefore take the view that it is necessary to redraft Article to avoid limiting de facto access to the networks for independent operators
Furthermore we believe it necessary to encourage the investments of independent access providers who are the natural partners of independent music producers in Europe
The reality is that European producers primarily need unrestricted and low-cost access to the networks in order to be able to offer the kind of music which the big multinationals regard as uneconomical in terms of their own commercial criteria
In offering their product on the Internet the companies also need to use systems compatible with the interfaces most commonly used by consumers as they cannot run the risk of investing in websites that might subsequently prove incompatible with the new versions of dominant software
Secondly European producers need programmes of support similar to those through which the audiovisual sector is supported via the media
Finally they need strategic research and development programmes that will allow the European music industry and the European technology industry to establish by common accord standards for the secure and effective distribution of music as an alternative to the American analogue standards
For all of these reasons the non-attached Members believe that it is right to reassess the situation and are therefore calling for the directive to be referred back to committee
Mr President creative and innovative activities will be critical to the development of the information society
This proposal for a directive is an important part of the legislative framework which is currently being drawn up at both a European and a global level to guarantee harmonious development of the information society
The information society is in fact evolving in a global context
In the international community adopted two treaties under the auspices of WIPO one on copyright and the other on interpretation and performance and on phonograms
I would remind the House that the European Union played a vital role in the drafting of those treaties
It can now accede to them as the European Community and be among the first to ratify them
The United States has already met its requirements
Thirty instruments of ratification will have to be deposited before the treaties enter into force
The European Union accounts for because of the agreements that link it to the countries of the European Economic Area and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the fact that it has association agreements with still more countries
Ratification of the treaties by the Union and its Member States is based on their incorporation into the national legal systems it is their incorporation into Community law that is among other things the objective of this proposal
Alongside meeting our international commitments the basic aim of the proposal is to put in place a harmonised legislative framework for copyright and related rights
We expect that greater legal certainty guaranteeing investment in creative and innovative activity and in the network infrastructures will boost growth and the competitiveness of the European industry and job creation
It is for us to tap this huge cultural and economic potential by providing the appropriate legislative framework
In drafting and adopting this proposal which as you will remember is the product of wide-ranging consultation dating back to the Commission has taken the greatest care to retain a fair balance between the various rights and interests at issue which are frequently in open conflict
I am well aware that this was also the aim of Parliament work
On behalf of the Commission I wish to thank the rapporteur Mr Barzanti for having done his job so efficiently
He has managed to combine a thorough understanding of the problem founded also on the earlier work on the Green Paper and the communication with the great resolve that tackling such sensitive proposals demands
Fifty-eight amendments have been tabled of which relate to the operative part of the text and to the recitals of those amendments the Commission is able to accept and to take into consideration but it has to reject 
The amendments the Commission is able to accept are the following Amendments Nos and 
The Commission will take into account the following amendments albeit with a number of mainly drafting changes Amendments Nos and the new Amendments Nos and 
As far as the recitals are concerned the Commission rejects Amendment No which in our view confuses protected work and information in general and is contrary to the principles of the acquis communautaire the first part of Amendment No which is incompatible with the WIPO treaty though we accept the second part
Amendment No which does not in our view succeed in defining the concept of public a responsibility we believe is best left to the Member States which are in a better position to define this somewhat elastic term
Amendment No which does not correspond to the amendments tabled in relation to Article b
Amendment No because it calls into question the approach taken in the proposal to the exceptions
Amendments Nos and which are already covered by the third recital and Amendments Nos and because they are too far outside the scope of the proposal
Turning then to the actual articles of the directive the Commission rejects Amendment No because the issue it tackles is taken into account in Article 
Amendments Nos and which are designed to introduce new exceptions for the benefit of broadcasters I wish to deal separately in just a moment with our rejection of Amendment No concerning Article Amendment No because the concern on which it is based is amply taken into account by Article c an amendment at your suggestion and Amendment No because that issue is being dealt with under the th recital amended by Amendment No 
As regards the amendments tabled at this part-session given that they either reflect viewpoints and concerns already taken into account in the report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens Rights or are amendments rejected by that committee the Commission endorses the report
Of the new amendments we are able to take into account only Nos and which relate to mediation a point mentioned by Mr Perry and taken up by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi
Overall the Commission is thus able to take Parliament line on many points
I repeat we are rejecting amendments taking account of and accepting 
To conclude I have two points to make concerning two specific issues
As far as the broadcasters are concerned the House is proposing to add three new exceptions for their benefit
I would remind you of our interest in observing a balance between the rights and interests which are at stake
The Commission accepts Amendment No which introduces an exception for broadcasters in respect of specific acts of reproduction necessary to facilitate a legitimate broadcasting act because it meets a genuine technological need
In contrast and in an effort to achieve a balance between the interests in play the Commission feels compelled to reject Amendments Nos and the first of which introduces an exception that would allow broadcasters to make available on request programmes largely consisting of phonograms
We then come to Article the source of such controversy
What is the purpose of that provision
It is designed to establish an exception to the right of reproduction in regard to some technical acts of reproduction that are an integral part of a technological process carried out for the sole purpose of enabling a different use to be made of the protected material
This is the only mandatory exception in the whole of the proposal and it is therefore very clearly drafted
That provision will give the telecommunications operators and service providers the legal certainty they need to be able to perform operations for the benefit of the network services which are very often transnational in nature
We have subdivided your proposals on this and are able to take account of some
As far as the definition of the scope of the exceptions is concerned we are able to accept the inclusion of the words transient and incidental as providing a closer definition of the concept of temporary that appears in our proposal and of the word essential which further defines the incidental nature of the act in relation to the technical transmission process
Consequently we reject Amendments Nos and which have the effect of watering down the latter condition
We cannot however accept the concept of economic significance for the rightholder
The reference to our concept of independent economic significance is consistent with the aim of the exception and therefore workable when the exception is actually applied
It is in any event worth bearing in mind that protection against unjustified economic harm is provided for in Article 
Finally we cannot accept the insertion of the clause referring to uses authorised or permitted by law the addition of which would mean that the exception would be triggered only in relation to items whose use had been authorised by the rightholders or permitted by law
We are aware of the concerns of rightholders who fear that the network will end up acting as a broadcasting vehicle for items that have been illegally copied pirated items but if we are to hit our target we have to consider beforehand what is the most workable and balanced way of achieving it
In this case that way has to be sought by ensuring a proper balance between rights and exceptions to those rights
Finally I would draw your attention to a very important group of amendments those concerning private copies
Your amendments uphold two important principles the right of rightholders to fair remuneration and the fine distinction concerning private digital copies
The first principle protects a need for equity it is a measured step forwards in the quest for legal certainty in this sector
The Commission acceptance of the amendment relating to digital copies for private use must be seen in the context of the approach already set out in recitals and of our proposal
Specifically in the light of what is set out in those sections of the proposal the Commission agrees to recognise the principle that in the digital sphere the possibility of making a copy for private use must exist without prejudice to the effective and workable technical means that are capable of protecting the interests of rightholders
We therefore align ourselves with the solution you have put forward though the amendment will have to be redrafted in such a way as to provide an accurate statement of the principle
You link not only analogue and digital copies for private use but also the exceptions concerning illustration and teaching to the principle of fair remuneration for rightholders
That is a formula which allows broader harmonisation and respects the traditions and practices of the Member States
The Commission is able to follow Parliament line here too and therefore accepts Amendments Nos and as well as Amendments No and 
The protection of technological measures forms the subject-matter of Article of the proposal which has been substantially recast by your Amendments Nos and 
We are able to take those amendments into consideration subject to a degree of clarification which the Commission considers important
We congratulate Mr Barzanti on a comprehensive and determined piece of work
I welcome the fact that you support the Commission proposal in terms of both the overall approach and I think I can honestly say this the main components
In the past Parliament influence has been decisive in the adoption of the five directives already in force the cooperation that exists between Parliament and the Commission in the field of copyright and related rights is something we can rely on and for that I am truly grateful
Mr President I put a specific question about the compatibility of this amended copyright directive with the proposal for a directive on electronic commerce that the Commission made to the Parliament and the Council
In the proposal on electronic commerce the country of origin is the principal component In this copyright directive it could be the country of destination
That is why I asked my question and the Commisioner did not answer it
Mr President I am fully aware that I did not answer This was because of time constraints
However I shall now answer very briefly
The Commission submitted its proposal on the legal framework for electronic commerce last year
Both proposals are independent and each has its own crucial importance
According to the proposal on electronic commerce the country of origin principle does not apply to intellectual and industrial property in accordance with existing international law
The debate is closed
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon
Common organisation of the market in wine
The next item is the report A by Mr P Martin on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council Regulation EC on the common organisation of the market in wine CCNS
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen the common organisation of the market in wine is certainly the most complex of all the COMs because it includes not only aspects relating to vineyard management and conditions of grape production but also all rules concerning oenological practices the processing of wine as well as rules on labelling
The very structure of the text of the COM in wine shows us that wine is an agricultural product rather than an industrial product
In the time I have been allocated I am not going to present all of the amendments that are included in my report and that are the result of a vote in committee on almost amendments tabled by all Members
I would like at this stage of my presentation to thank firstly all the officials in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and all those colleagues who made my task easier for me and enabled me to draw up a coherent report
What are the central themes of my report
Firstly a significant number of amendments concern the decision-making procedure
The Commission in its proposal wanted to have sole authority to change the rules
In my report we have asked that the procedure known as the Article procedure be reinstated so that the Council takes decisions on the basis of proposals from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament
I personally believe that this procedure although cumbersome will allow us to preserve specific rules for wine promoting its status as an agricultural product
In view of wine imports from third countries and the intentions that some people have as we well know European wine must retain its status as a local quality product
In this connection the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted an amendment which I had put forward prohibiting the vinification of musts imported from third countries
If this proposal is accepted by the Council in the form in which we adopted it the quality image of European wines will be preserved
With regard to structure the Committee on Agriculture adopted the principle of the right to growth by an increase of % in the vineyard while preserving restrictions on planting
Vineyards with an expanding market will be able to obtain other rights on condition that the Member States and where appropriate their regions genuinely monitor them
This was what led us to adopt a specific amendment on maintaining the rules on the computerised vineyard register
The duration of planting rights has been extended to allow the land to be rested as necessary

We think that it is worth pointing out the effort and the persistence that the Commissioner has demonstrated on this dossier
I would also emphasise the contributions of the three rapporteurs
With regard to the COPE Fund it is as has already been said here a supplement
It is intended to meet the needs and the cover the risks of the most serious situations such as those that have been mentioned here at some length
Beyond this many other risks remain
Of course maritime transport which is subject to the rules of competition must also have its rules strengthened under the IMO in order to enable its economic activities to continue to be profitable without sacrificing safety not only in Europe and the United States but in all seas and oceans
The timeliness and the objectives of the agency have also already been discussed here at some length
I think that the rapporteur reasonably points out some loopholes but I also feel that it is not Parliament place to manage the agency but instead to supervise the administrative rules and good practices of this and other similar agencies
What the agency must guarantee is absolute fairness and equal cooperation between the Member States and must also ensure the participation of the public of those in the profession and of the other economic and social interests concerned
The agency independence must therefore be a paradigm an essential factor for it to be respected for it to allay the concerns of the public and to develop and encourage plans for action and cooperation at European level
This is certainly what is needed and as many speakers have stated here there are many potential locations for the agency since there are several candidates which are all equally competent and well prepared
I think that Lisbon is probably the most appropriate
Mr President if Cyprus and Malta accede to the Union or rather when not if the Union will have the largest merchant fleet in the world
Not so much because these two countries are huge maritime powers but because many shipowners find them convenient and I use the English term advisedly
A large fleet is an advantage of that there can be no doubt But it entails a great deal of responsibility
We must therefore ensure that our fleet is safe safety on our own doorstep is paramount but elsewhere too the European flag must stand for quality
When I reported to Parliament on enlargement and transport I held a great many talks with people in positions of responsibility in the candidate countries
They were all very quick to promise that they would transpose the relevant acquis into their national law
However as I pointed out even then things were still in the pipeline especially the Erika II package under discussion today
That alone was cause for concern
Talks on transposing European law or to use the Community jargon implementing the acquis soon got bogged down
In one case I was even told that the inspector responsible was on holiday
We shall need much more than one inspector if we want to use serious prompt all-encompassing controls in order to prevent further disasters on our or anyone else doorstep
We shall need sufficient numbers of trained inspectors and we shall need them quickly
The present Member States can do a great deal to help here
Twinning and the temporary secondment of well-trained specialists working in existing management and control structures recently proved to be a very effective instrument in reintegrating former East Germany
We could apply this model here too
With measures to guarantee that foreseeable problems will be dealt with promptly by well-organised accession mechanisms we could contribute to the success of the enlargement process and more importantly win our citizens over
There are already more than enough concerns and fears on the question of enlargement
We must address these concerns and fears be they major concerns or concerns about individual specialist aspects such as those under discussion today
I almost said there are a lot of Irish among us
Parliamentarians on the Administrative Board not the best way of involving Parliament I think
The Commission should monitor the agency and we should monitor the Commission
As an Austrian I unfortunately have no high-sea ports to offer
We lost our last sea battle a hundred years ago
But I should like to think that we too could offer a pleasing location should one be wanted
Mr President ladies and gentlemen it is high time we woke up and noticed the kind of environmental and safety risks associated with maritime transport and particularly with tankers
Oil catastrophes have concretely shown that relying on good luck costs society dear
Unfortunately difficult decisions often make progress only when a catastrophe and the reactions of voters force politicians to act
The Erika II package under discussion therefore deserves all possible support
I would like to congratulate all three rapporteurs for drawing up thorough reports
The Erika II package certains very many positive proposals among which I would particularly like to mention the setting up of emergency ports and the automatic monitoring of vessels
The setting up of a maritime safety agency will also improve coordination on safety issues
Although we Europeans can affect the condition of our maritime environment very significantly we must always remember that we are not alone in the world even after enlargement
A large number of vessels originating from other than EU Member States travel near the shores of Europe
Therefore we must take care that the well-intentioned measures of Europe do not impede the creation of international agreements
One example is the European oil pollution compensation fund COPE
Setting up the fund must not mean reducing willingness to achieve a wider solution under the auspices of the IMO
Oil pollutes just as much and clean-up costs are identical whether the vessel is registered in the EU or for example under the Liberian flag
Ladies and gentlemen safeguarding the cleanliness of our seas and especially our coastline means we must not hesitate a minute longer
It is time to act decisively so that the worst problems can be removed once and for all
In this way we will ensure that no Jessica Angelica or even Marika Package is required in the future
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would first of all like to thank and congratulate the three rapporteurs Mr Sterckx Mr Mastorakis and Mr Esclopé on their magnificent reports on the safety of maritime traffic the creation of a European Maritime Safety Agency and compensation for oil pollution
Furthermore I would like to thank them for having presented and prepared these reports within such a short timescale and for the attention they have paid to the problem of maritime safety
However like many of today speakers I regret the fact that we are discussing the Erika II package without having yet adopted Erika I although I hope that within the conciliation procedure we will achieve a positive result as soon as possible
Nevertheless I would also like to say that the Erika I and Erika II packages are already having practical effects within the International Maritime Organisation where we have managed to make progress on making double-hulled or similar ships compulsory for the transportation of oil and also with regard to the current discussion on increasing the figures in order to cover liabilities which will very possibly exceed USD million they are currently million and also in relation to countries such as Cyprus and Malta which and I address this to Mr Rack are making an enormous effort to improve the characteristics of their fleets within the framework of their incorporation into the European Union accepting the requirements of the Erika I and Erika II packages before they enter into force
Before the end of the year I will present a proposal on safety on ferries although we know what happened in the case of the Samina Express they were watching football
Greek justice is taking action
I believe we must mark out territories
It is the Member States who have all the responsibilities in the criminal field
I will refer to the proposed directive on maritime traffic which is the most advanced one in terms of its preparation and I believe this is indicated by the consensus in relation to it
We broadly support all the amendments with slight modifications of the wording of those which are aimed at improving or specifying the scope of the text
Also in part with some modifications Amendments Nos and which are extremely important on the refuge area
With some modifications the amendments which are aimed at improving the assessment of the implementation of the Directive on the ground specifically Amendments Nos and 
We cannot accept the current wording of Amendment No on black boxes although I understand the rapporteur objectives the formulation used makes this requirement dependent on a prior decision by the IMO
We are not prepared to accept this
If the IMO is able to make progress we will have to move ahead but we know that good work is being done within the International Maritime Organisation and what we want is to put more pressure on as we have done in the case of double hulls
With regard to the proposal for the European Maritime Safety Agency I would thank you for Parliament positive approach to our proposal and the support it is giving us
This is not a purely administrative measure but rather the Agency will increase the public visibility of the European Union commitment to increasing maritime safety to the highest possible level and preventing pollution from ships
I would like to say to those people who are concerned that the Agency may become another Community bureaucratic body that the Agency will enable the Member States to be part of and participate in an area which as we all know involves national and Community responsibilities and competences and through which we have to seek integration in order to better coordinate these actions
The Agency will enable the Commission and the Member States to work together in an independent body and that is one of its advantages
Parliament amendments do not alter the spirit of the Commission proposal and focus principally on the administrative structure
The Commission supports Amendments Nos and and we can also accept Amendment No which makes it possible for the Agency to offer technical assistance to the candidate countries without a specific request from the Commission
We can also accept Amendments Nos and which clarify the mandate of the principal directors of this body
In relation to Amendments Nos and on the Administrative Board I must say that we accept Amendments Nos and insofar as they eliminate the presence of Parliament and if these amendments are incorporated we will have to make the necessary adjustments
In relation to the location of the Agency Amendment No seems more logical than No 
Objective criteria are specified for the selection and I fully agree with this and believe that it can be incorporated
We accept that the external evaluation of the Agency be subject to the conditions set by the Administrative Board as Amendment No requests in part although we do not think it is necessary to repeat the evaluation every years as it suggests
With regard to the visits which the officials of the agencies must make to the Member States the Commission wishes the national administrations to actively participate in them and to assist them
We cannot therefore accept either Amendment No or No which contravene this objective
I understand the justification for Amendment No but for reasons of legal certainty I cannot accept it since the term independent adds nothing to a body with its own legal personality
Nor can I accept Amendments Nos and which imply that it is not necessary for the Commission to approve the Agency programme nor Amendments Nos and according to which the decision to make visits to the Member States should depend on a Commission opinion rather than on its agreement
Supervising the implementation of the Community acquis will remain the responsibility of the Commission and the Agency cannot replace us in this task
Lastly the Commission cannot agree with Amendments Nos and which affect the impartiality of the executive director
With regard to the third proposal on responsibility and compensation for the dumping of oil I would like to congratulate Mr Esclopé and Parliament on your work on such a complex issue
I would like to make it clear that the problems do not relate to the underlying objectives but only to the means of achieving these objectives and we should try to solve all the problems by means of a proposal designed to deal with one specific issue the lack of adequate compensation in the case of serious oil pollution
Furthermore I agree with what Mr Esclopé has said If we now add to this proposal the problems relating to other types of dumping to pollution from chemical dumping or from the cleaning out of bilge we will eventually paralyse the initiative
These types of proposals are specifically related to Conventions which are awaiting ratification and which must be ratified over the next few years
I am also prepared for us to also make some regional proposals in the event that existing Conventions are not ratified by a sufficient number of States that are members of the IMO
But since there is already an international proposal I believe that we should not be too hasty
The perfect is the enemy of the good
Let us concentrate on the dumping of oil on which we have data and certain factors which will allow us to move forward quickly
We can accept three groups of amendments which altogether make up more or less half of them
The first the nineteen amendments which seek to extend the scope of the Regulation to cover substances other than oil such as chemical and combustible substances are not acceptable as I have pointed out
The second group of amendments which refer to the role of shipowners in the COPE Fund Amendments Nos to and which seek to introduce compulsory contributions for shipowners are not compatible with international law since the international rules in force do not allow demands for additional compensation from shipowners unless the accident has been caused by fraudulent behaviour
This is one of the problems detected by the Commission in the international system in force which must be rectified on an international level and we are committed to working on this
Nevertheless given the current situation requiring shipowners to participate in compensation for damages would contravene the current international rules and we are therefore unable to accept such a proposal
But I must say that Amendments Nos to and also cause problems for the Commission because their aim is to strengthen the participation of the local representatives of the polluted region in the COPE Fund committee procedures
I would remind you that this committee is covered by the Decision on commitology and Community law does not allow its composition to be changed
Nor can we accept Amendment No which proposes removing the paragraph establishing the possibility of rejecting compensation to claimants involved in the accident that is to say shipowners charterers and company directors
It would not make sense to compensate those responsible for the pollution
I therefore prefer to keep this paragraph which allows the rejection of payments to the parties most involved in the pollution
We have problems with Amendment No which proposes reducing the period for collecting contributions and lastly with Amendments Nos and which create difficulties in practice because they fall outside the scope of the proposal
All the others either in their entirety or in part can be accepted
They are Nos and from to 
I will end by once again thanking the rapporteurs for the speed and quality of their work as well as the whole of the committee and Parliament as a whole for their support for the Erika I and Erika II packages in their entirety
I hope that all the remaining stages of negotiations in both forums will maintain the highest quality in terms of the texts and the proposals and will be completed as quickly as possible
I would also like to say that before the end of the year we shall be submitting proposals on safety in the transportation of persons of passengers
We would have liked to achieve everything by now but we must understand that sometimes we cannot achieve what everybody wants
We have however taken very significant steps forward which I insist have already had real consequences by improving safety on our seas
The debate is closed
The vote will be held tomorrow at am
Occurrence reporting in civil aviation
The next item is the debate on the report A by Mr Collins on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy Transport and Tourism on occurrence reporting in civil aviation
Mr President the continued increase in air traffic which is expected to double over the next decade is placing unprecedented pressure on air travel safety
It has been well documented that air transport is a very safe mode of transport and this should and must remain the case
However we must all work to ensure that air accidents are reduced to a bare minimum
The continent of Europe accounts for about % of all accidents worldwide while one third of air traffic takes place in European skies
It is clear that a large proportion of the measures needed to improve air safety should be geared towards preventing accidents rather than providing a response when accidents have happened
Incidents occurring in one Member State are not necessarily known in another Member State and similar circumstances can lead to fatal accidents
That is why I welcome this European Commission proposal
As a result of this new initiative all European Union Member States will establish formal incident-reporting systems to facilitate the collection of information on actual or potential safety deficiencies involving aeroplanes in Europe
Setting up a system that allows for safety and civil aviation authorities to share information available from the different reporting schemes will enable all parties involved learn from their mistakes thereby producing a safer system for all air users in future
Article of the Treaty of Maastricht introduced the legal basis for the introduction of Community measures to improve the level of transport safety in Europe thereby creating a Community competence in this field
The adoption of a directive on accident and investigation in November was the first EU response to the use of these new powers
However the limitation of the directive was that as the number of accidents is fortunately very low the opportunities to learn from them are very limited and lessons can therefore be drawn only after an accident has already happened
It is now proposed to complement this first initiative with a new directive that would address both mandatory and confidential reporting of incidents defects or malfunctions which may constitute a hazard for civil aviation operations called occurrences
The objective of this new directive is to contribute to the improvement of air safety by ensuring that essential safety information is reported and collected stored protected and disseminated in order to facilitate its effective analysis and monitoring
A network of national mandatory occurrence reporting systems will be based on a system developed by the Joint Research Centre in Ispra in Italy
These reporting systems would also be complemented by the creation of confidential reporting mechanisms which will be put in place across the territories of the European Union
The proposed European Aviation Safety Agency will need this kind of data if it is to carry out its work effectively
In conclusion it is incumbent on all legislators within the European Union to ensure that the utmost is being done to ensure that air travellers are entirely safe in the journeys they take
The specific proposal is part of a number of measures presently being proposed by the Committee on Transport of this Parliament to improve the quality and safety standards of air travel for all users
Mr President the establishment of formal reporting systems is clearly a requirement of Annex VI to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation
The United Kingdom has a long-standing mandatory reporting scheme MORS currently established under Article of the Air Navigation Order and administered by the CAA
There are several established systems for the interchange of safety data for analysis such as JAA EUROCONTROL etc as well as legal ICAO requirements
I would suggest that any EU initiative be compatible with the proven effective systems in place
My initial concerns were as follows first although the proposal insists on confidentiality and disidentification of reported information which is a purely legal issue it does not satisfactorily tackle the issue of information abuse especially since data could be made available to third parties through many different channels including the so-called and loosely-defined research institutions etc
Aviation is always under close scrutiny by the media and such additional opportunities for reporting would inevitably be misused
It is therefore necessary that all parties using and providing data can genuinely trust the system
My second concern referred to Article and Annexes I and II
It is generally thought amongst safety experts that it is not the quantity of data that is important but the quality of the reporting and analysis
The lists of examples of reportable occurrences may need to be addressed
As it stands the proposal could become over-regulated difficult to manage and have no added safety benefit
My third point referred to Article 
I believe it is essential that reports from pilots and other staff members be made to their own company
Bypassing their own company structures would weaken the internal reporting processes that have been built up over the years
My final point refers to Article which appears to go too far by establishing a totally blame-free reporting system
This would need to be amended as there could be circumstances in which gross negligence is involved
My own experience over a number of years has shown that confidential reporting works extremely well
However in such a safety-sensitive industry it is important that all employees follow the strict rules regulations and practices that are laid down
I would like to thank Mr Collins for producing a comprehensive report
It was a great pleasure to work with him
I believe that we have now reached a sensible conclusion and would hope that the amendments adopted in committee which address those concerns can be supported in the plenary vote
Honourable Members I am in no doubt that all of us here welcome initiatives to enhance safety but they must be well thought through and beneficial to the entire aviation industry and the public at large
I should like to suspend the debate at this point
We shall resume the debate on this item at pm
Question Time Commission
The next item is Question Time B We shall now take questions to the Commission
Part one
Question No by H
Subject Cooperation with Afghanistan In its joint position on Afghanistan adopted on January the European Union condemns human rights violations in that country and in particular discrimination against women
What information and guarantees can the Commission give concerning access for Afghan women to European aid and cooperation programmes launched under the aegis of ECHO
The Commission wishes to underline its concern for the suffering of the entire civilian population of Afghanistan as a direct consequence of the ongoing conflict and the current drought
In this respect ECHO has this year already allocated EUR million for humanitarian aid to Afghanistan
ECHO is focusing particularly attention to vulnerable groups internally displaced people of which there are more than half a million the disabled women particularly widows and children
The needs of women and children are specifically addressed in mother-and-child health programmes
Projects are being implemented by Médecins Sans Frontires of Belgium Médecins Sans Frontires of the Netherlands and from France Action contre la Faim Aid Médicale Internationale and Médecins du Monde
All aim to treat malnutrition among children under five years of age as well as monitoring the health status of women in particular nursing mothers and pregnant women
Usually NGOs also provide their female patients with elementary hygiene education
These projects are implemented in areas where internally displaced people have settled
Currently there are medical projects in the Panjsher Valley Herat Kandahar Kabul Mazar-e-Sharif and Hazarajad
NGOs have access to all beneficiaries women included and can employ women as local NGO personnel in medical programmes in spite of the fact that separation between the sexes has to be strictly observed
For instance ACF employs between and per cent of women in its medical programmes
Medical NGOs play an important role in the professional training of women
They organise medical training sessions for small groups of women in cooperation with the Taleban Ministry of Health
We also carry out Food-for-Work projects
Income-generating activities for women which encourage self-sufficiency are increasingly supported by ECHO
Since ECHO has financed Food-for-Work projects in Kabul for men and women through German Agro Action and Medair from Switzerland
While men are occupied in land recovery works and city drain cleaning women are given raw materials and knitted quilts and sweaters to be distributed to other beneficiaries
This kind of programme entails the participation of women from a variety of socio-economic classes from educated to illiterate women each using their knowledge all manual abilities
They are paid a fixed rate in wheat seed every two weeks
This pilot project in Kabul was subject to an independent evaluation which proved to be very positive
MEDAIR is in the process of implementing a second phase
Similar operations are now funded by ECHO in Mazar Kandahar Herat Kabul and Faizabad through UN Habitat and various NGOs
On other types of project I can inform you that NGOs with the support of ECHO try whenever possible to have women involved in each project
Even in shelter programmes women are involved
Female health monitors go from house to house visiting women in order to provide them with basic information on hygiene primary health care and conservation of water and food
Operational partners such as NGOs international organisations and Red Cross family and UN agencies closely monitor all operations through expatriates and local staff present in the field
All ECHO partners are bound by a framework partnership agreement which obliges them to be present and in relation to us to present financial and operational reports of their activities on a regular basis
Furthermore ECHO has field experts who also follow the ongoing projects very closely to ensure correct delivery of aid
Recently following UN sanctions and meetings in Europe with General Massud the Northern Alliance commander meetings in Europe the hardliners within the Taleban movement seem to be gaining the upper hand as reflected in the hardening of their position against work by women
Unfortunately this general state of affairs is escalating as we can read in press reports now
However in conclusion we can say that despite the difficulties NGOs in Afghanistan are doing their best as our partners to alleviate the suffering of women in the country
ECHO is not carrying out development cooperation as such but is delivering humanitarian aid
Clearly for many Afghans women and men educated and uneducated the activities we support are a valuable and by and large the only form of assistance
Maintaining access for this humanitarian aid is crucial and we will continue our work even if the circumstances are difficult and appear to be worsening at present
I am planning to visit Afghanistan in September with a view to stepping up this effort
Commissioner thank you for your very detailed answer particularly with regard to Afghan women
You know that the President of the European Parliament and some other MEPs too received a delegation from Afghanistan
We very much want to support them and be by their side
Despite your detailed answer I do have to ask you for further information
In France Médecins du Monde has been rallying its efforts over the last few days to alert people about the famine and drought in Afghanistan
Yesterday they came here to Parliament once again
As we know drought is a terrible thing and this drought appears to be the worst in years
We also know that there is no water irrigation system to combat it
Nothing has been done for years there are no dams for example
The situation is terrible and it would now appear that the harvests are down by % a quarter of the population is directly affected by drought and hunger and one million people are heading for the borders
Apparently life in the camps is increasingly dangerous and according to Médecins du Monde food distribution in Afghanistan is extremely erratic
Given this situation I need to be able to respond Commissioner as in the dossier being circulated by its members Médecins du Monde has condemned the fact that the European Union contribution has fallen from million in to million in 
We are therefore moving towards a decrease in aid and assistance to Afghanistan
I would like you to give me an answer on this issue and also to tell me whether given this situation the politics the drought and all the problems that you have mentioned it would not be more crucial to increase our food aid and to put in place a genuine comprehensive policy on humanitarian aid
Even if this exists you did mention this should it not be better coordinated
The problem is that the answer to the drought disaster in Afghanistan would be systematic normal broader-based development cooperation
But the situation in that country does not make it possible to organise and implement normal development cooperation
What we are doing is making a relatively large-scale effort in terms of humanitarian aid
This year ECHO has identified Afghanistan as one of the forgotten conflicts in order to focus on and raise awareness of the need to mobilise international society
It is also clear that the access problem is a real one partly because of politics in Afghanistan
The major challenge we face is to restate and explain the need for everyone involved on both sides of the conflict to accept unhindered access to the country by humanitarian organisations
This will be the focus of my efforts when I go there in September
Question No by H
Subject Commission intentions and actions with regard to the global fund to combat HIVAIDS malaria and tuberculosis While welcoming the increased international attention paid to the tragic and immense consequences of the HIVAIDS epidemic malaria and tuberculosis including the Commission programme for accelerated action in this field it is obvious that there is an urgent need for efforts far beyond this initiative and indeed beyond the pharmaceutical industry lowering of prices in order to address the pressing needs in terms of prevention as well as treatment
The UN Secretary-General recently proposed the establishment of a global fund to combat HIVAIDS malaria and tuberculosis and urged donors to make firm commitments before the UN General Assembly special session on HIVAIDS in June
The amount needed has been estimated at $billion per year
President Bush recently announced an initial US pledge of $ million
In the light of the Commission programme for action what are its intentions as regards the global fund
Is the Commission prepared to take the lead in this issue and contribute significantly to the fund
 The direct answer to the question of whether the Commission will actually contribute money to this fund is that at this stage we do not have an answer
I will try to explain
We made a joint Council and Commission declaration on the proposal for a global health fund at the Development Council meeting on May
I will quote from the first part of this The Council and the Commission note with concern the devastating impact of HIV AIDS and other communicable diseases on human suffering and on economic and social development and hence also on poverty reduction efforts
The proposal by the UN Secretary-General to establish a global HIV AIDS and health fund is therefore fully welcomed
The Commission and Member States will explore how best to develop this initiative
The Commission is taking an active part in the negotiations concerning the modalities and all the issues relating to this fund
There are a number of points we consider important
I will go through them quoting from a speech I made on this issue during the LDC Conference on May
First we would wish to see a number of principles or conditions fulfilled
I will name just a few
One donors should make available additional and new resources over an extended period of time
The Commission does not have access to additional resources
We have a specific budget
The Commission is not in a position to tax directly as you all know
So it is in fact the political decision-makers who decide on taxation who can provide additional resources We cannot
Two the OECD countries need to take measures to assume a fair share of the global financial burden of reducing poverty and disease
Three we do not support single-issue funds and plead for a broad approach targeting the three major communicable diseases malaria tuberculosis and HIV AIDS
Four we will continue to raise the need for country ownership integration with national development strategies and health systems development effective coordination on the ground and keeping prevention efforts to the fore
This is crucial
If all this is not helped by a fund the fund is no help at all
So does it improve delivery
We have had enough empty donor-driven manifestations
If the answer to the question about delivery is not a clear yes the establishment of the fund will only be like crossing the creek to get wet feet
Five a fund should be open to contributions from all interested parties both public and private and should support action beyond the public sector
Six the governing structure of the funds should be light and transparent
The basic and multilaterally agreed health policy principles of WHO should be secured on how it is managed
Seven the fund should be outcome-driven as opposed to input-focused
Eight decreased transaction costs for countries should be a priority
Finally I wish to say that a global fund cannot succeed and will not get our support without a commitment from industry to a global tiered pricing system
These conditions may look very demanding but they represent in fact the mainstream of shared international policy in this area
It would be a tragic mistake to organise a fund which is supposed to be a procurement fund for special expensive types of medicine
Today this is something which we more or less agree upon But that is not how discussion about the fund started out
Much of the discussion so far has been meaningful but please note that as far as mobilising money is concerned today we are not even allowed to provide core funding for UN organisations
Even under the new financial regulation which we hope to get but do not yet have we will not be allowed to carry out normal core funding although we hope to be allowed to provide programme-based funding for UN organisations
This fund however will not be a UN organisation
What is on the cards here is to ensure core funding for this fund
None of this is as easy as it may be portrayed in the press but we are in substance a very active player in contributing to making the fund a meaningful and well-organised entity
Thank you Commissioner Nielson for a very full and in many parts interesting reply
I believe we agree that this is one of the most serious epidemics and not only one of the most serious humanitarian catastrophes but one of the most serious economic catastrophes the world has even seen
As much as ten years ago based on the ways the disease was spread sexual practices of the time and the widespread poverty in many African countries experts were able to make forecasts showing that there would be a spread similar to that which we have today and which has had such incredibly tragic consequences
Unfortunately we are now able to make the same forecasts for other parts of the world which were infected later and the outlook is similar
The only way to proceed is naturally prevention with a mixture of support initiatives for those already affected and preventive initiatives partly in the form of information and education and partly in the form of efforts to find a vaccine
I naturally agree with the Commissioner that no problems will be solved simply by setting up a fund
I also agree with many of the requirements for such a mechanism which Mr Nielson sets out
At the same time it was my experience in setting up UNAIDS of whose board I was a member that we constantly had too little money and were able to implement far too few ambitious initiatives
During the years of setting up the project we actually had no money whatsoever to support the national initiatives in the countries most affected
At the same time as Mr Nielson has stated the UN bodies normal budgets have fallen which means that we are suffering from a major lack of money
I am sure that money is needed to achieve success in terms of research and active initiatives at national level
I therefore believe that Kofi Annan initiative is good as long as this mechanism can be set up in a good and non-bureaucratic way
I appreciate that the Commission cannot conjure up money from nowhere
However there was a major surplus in the EU budget for last year which has recently been returned to the Member States
It must surely have been possible in such an extraordinary situation to gain support from the Council for a substantial aid package
It would otherwise look very strange bearing in mind the Commission very great commitment in the course of last year and the initiative in which Mr Nielson and others were involved in September October 
I would also like to test Mr Nielson a little further
Given that the soundings ahead of the New York Summit in a little under a month time are positive and that this mechanism can be set up properly what plans are there for us in the EU Member States and the EU itself to be able to put forward a decent sum to bolster the preventive work
It is very true that not only is this a human tragedy it is also an economic disaster the mathematics of which are simply paralysing
This is also true in cases where countries choose to opt for treatment
Treating HIV-positive persons may mean that many of them can continue functioning as schoolteachers or whatever
But the treatment is ongoing year after year and the impact on national health budgets even if they are given these anti-retroviral drugs for free is incredible
The real bottleneck in the use of advanced complex medical treatments is not necessarily access to the drugs but the organisation of their delivery
Few people realise that we are talking about to different pills or medications that have to be taken at intervals of a couple of hours around the clock that their composition has to be changed every few weeks and that all of this has to be very strictly and precisely organised
On top of this all these persons need safe drinking water and at least two good varied meals per day
In a developing country that is asking quite a lot
The reality is not so easy
We have been informed that Merck and the Gates Foundation have jointly set up a USD million fund for Lesotho
On top of that Merck has provided free medicine in order to solve the problems of delivery on the ground
They have been working on this for a year without much progress
This is why it is not just an evasive response to lay stress on prevention
We have seen that it can work in the case of Uganda and in other places too we are beginning to see the AIDS curve go down
I appreciate the response from Mr Wijkman
It is true that these organisations need money
We will come to this in the next question
But it will never be the role of the Commission to be a major supplier of general funding as such for the UN organisations
Freeing up additional money for these purposes is the role of the primary donors that is the governments who have the right to tax their citizens
That is how we mobilise additional money
It may also be possible to mobilise new private money
I hope this fund will be a breakthrough by doing so on a systematic basis
As to our own unspent money the fact is not that we have money floating around which we then send back to Member States
The way the system is administratively organised in the case of the European Development Fund is that we call in money on a quarterly basis from the treasuries of the Member States on an ongoing basis
We have real commitments that have not been translated into actions in terms of spending the money
But as I have told Parliament on many occasions we are going through the whole portfolio reducing and scrapping those commitments that are not implementable and accelerating the flow in the pipeline
Most of the money is in principle committed implementation is the real challenge
As you were informed earlier the rate of commitment from now on for AIDS activities will be at the level of about EUR million a year
This shows that in terms of contribution we are a major player and are making a big effort in these countries
The question remains to be answered will we be allowed to do it legally and will this fund actually mean improved ability to deliver on the ground
These are the questions that we need to come back to
The Commissioner will be aware that this Parliament supported the change to the financial regulation which should at least partly ease his path
I should like to ask him two supplementary questions
First as he said in his answer there are many ongoing discussions
We very much welcome the summit that was called by Kofi Annan
We very much welcome his own round table which was organised last year and which made substantial progress at European level
I am aware that there is a proposal for a further such round table jointly between the European Union and US interests
Would the Commissioner comment on whether he feels such a proposal is timely and whether he would be interested in participating in such a meeting
Secondly after the South African case Mr Nielson colleague Mr Lamy did commit European Union technical assistance to developing countries afflicted by the HIV AIDS pandemic to utilise the national emergencies clause in the WTO to examine the use of generic drugs and of parallel importing to secure affordable medicines
Would the Commissioner comment on whether the European Commission has been successful in identifying developing countries to utilise these monies in this way and what further steps he plans to take in order to achieve this
Mr President during the LDC Conference I met with the new administrator of US Aid and I can tell Mr Howitt that the issues he was looking at largely mirrored those I have mentioned today namely prevention of HIVAIDS the real problem being delivery and so on
That was more promising than many other things we hear from his government
It remains to be seen whether the announced contribution of USD million from the US Government to this fund is approved by Congress and whether it will in fact be additional money but that does not form part of our more restricted deliberations here
It is useful to pursue the dialogue with the United States on these issues especially where we could feasibly agree on a practical approach so I will continue working in this vein
As to the second question on using the national emergencies clause as a basis for opening up for some of the elements in the TRIPS Agreement have been sending a clear signal to our partners in the developing world that the Commission is interested in supporting their efforts to find and use the most flexible interpretation of the Agreement and we have also stated as we did at a joint meeting with the CEOs of the major pharmaceutical companies that Pascal Lamy and myself attended that we see a need to check the existing agreement so as to ensure that the interpretation is good enough to facilitate better use of these possibilities in developing countries
However we have not pinpointed any specific cases on which we can focus and act in a concrete manner
That said we have expressed a strong desire to do so
What we have done is to apply pressure by announcing a total untying with regard to all essential drugs used to treat these transmittable diseases
Opening up not only regionally but also globally should make price differentiation more difficult
It should also make for a change in stance from bidders from around the world and from the generic drug producers
Mr President first I would like to thank the Commissioner for his answers today
No one who has listened to the Commissioner over the last few years in this House could doubt his commitment to removing poverty and disease from the world as efficiently and effectively as possible using EU-resources
I wanted to ask him a question about the third disease mentioned in this report and suggest to him that perhaps we should concentrate on this least glamorous of the three because tuberculosis could be eradicated
Unfortunately HIV as you say is likely to be with us for a long time and at the moment we are largely into palliative care as regards HIVAIDS
A concerted world programme over a relatively short period of time could eliminate tuberculosis from the world
I have a particular interest in this because the cure was actually pioneered in my home city of Edinburgh years ago
We thought we had eradicated it in western Europe but it is re-emerging now
If we can remove it from the developing nations we can also remove it from the world permanently
That is the prize the permanent removal which is unfortunately not yet available to us as regards the two other diseases
Even if there is a delay in getting the World Fund going on the other diseases perhaps we could suggest to Kofi Annan and the UN that we have a pilot project concentrating specifically on tuberculosis which might inspire nations to contribute to the other areas once we see success in this area
This is a highly significant point
This is one of the reasons why we have insisted all along it has not always been easy because public attention has been almost exclusively focused on HIVAIDS that malaria TB and HIVAIDS have to be looked at in the same manner
The best economic data we have to illustrate the benefits of doing these things efficiently relate to polio eradication
It has been documented that the world can save USD billion per year in ongoing costs if we can mobilise the USD million it takes for a year final offensive to wipe out the remaining centres of active polio around Nigeria and northern India
It is absolutely feasible and it is an incredible pay-back
As regards TB the mathematics are similar but it is more difficult to eradicate
For TB and malaria the economics of the cure are very different
They cannot in fact be compared to HIVAIDS for which there is no cure only treatment in the mortality rate of HIV-positive persons in the world
If we did what we ought to do for malaria and TB that would bring about as much improvement as we could ever achieve with anti-retrovirals
This is the real issue
There is good reason to give more attention to TB and malaria
This was the main contribution of our action programme
It was also supported by the round table last September
It is exactly for that reason that I am somewhat stubborn about creating such a fund when we are not sure about the modalities and the policy of that fund
I therefore welcome the contribution concerning TB

Subject Vegetable protein crops in the Union The ban on animal meal could have provided an opportunity for expanding vegetable protein production in the Union but the Commission without any consultation decided to rule out any such plan claiming the cost would be too high
However encouraging farmers to grow protein crops would have allowed us to restore balance to European farming by escaping from cereal monoculture which requires the increased use of fungicides
This decision will also inevitably entail huge and ever-increasing GM soya imports from the US
On what data did the Commission base its conclusion that the financial cost involved in a protein crop programme would outweigh the need to combat soil impoverishment a serious degree of food dependence and increased use of GMOs in Europe
Mr President honourable members ladies and gentlemen following the new restrictions on the use of meat and bonemeal in feedingstuffs in the wake of the BSE crisis and at the request of the Nice European Council and the Agriculture Council the Commission has thoroughly investigated the supply of and demand for oil and protein crops
The European Council expressly stated in its conclusions that any proposals for measures need to respect the financial perspectives
Our findings are contained in the Commission communication to the Council of March on options for promoting the cultivation of protein crops in the European Union
According to simulations carried out by the Commission services a significant increase in aid per hectare for protein crops would only have a very limited effect on the areas cultivated in the Community
The main reason for this very slight increase is that cereals are much more attractive crops and greater increases in world market prices are forecast for cereals than for protein crops
In order to promote organic farming the Community has allowed fodder pulses to be used on holdings which comply strictly with organic farming standards
Whether or not more products containing GMOs will be farmed in future depends on licensing arrangements and consumer acceptance in the Community
In the final analysis market trends will obviously be the deciding factor
The decision to favour growing organic fodder legumes alone has not reassured the operators in this sector
Imports of soya have increased as have the prices
Can you give us any assurance that there will not be any genuine speculation
How will the farmers be able to resist this
The food scares have plunged them into an economic crisis
The only alternative that they have been given today is based on soya imports whereas we cannot even guarantee them that this soya has not been genetically modified
I can gladly give the honourable Member this assurance because you must bear the following in mind not all the meat and bonemeal produced in the past was used in feedingstuffs
Half a million tonnes of meat and bonemeal were exported every year and another half a million tonnes of meat and bonemeal were used to make dog and cat food every year Only the remainder was used in feedingstuffs
If you then also bear in mind that recently more soya was used than was needed for nutritional purposes because the feedingstuff manufacturers calculated that it was in their interest to do so then the protein balance in feedingstuffs barely changes
The amendment to the ban on feeding fishmeal and meat and bonemeal to pigs and poultry accounts for less than % in the import system in terms of volume
Less than % is simply not enough to trigger huge speculation or somehow put the Community under pressure
Question No by H
Subject Impact of the fisheries non-agreement with Morocco Of the funding earmarked for renewing the fisheries agreement with Morocco how much is the Commission proposing to allocate to the restructuring of the sector
Under which Community funds will the new Restructuring Plan be financed
Mr President ladies and gentlemen may I start by reminding the House that the principle of subsidiarity has to be respected in structural policy
But this also means that when restructuring plans are being programmed it is the individual Member State which is initially responsible for drafting the plans and submitting them to the Commission
Obviously the Commission works in close liaison with individual national authorities in such cases
In principle more funds could be used to resolve the problems caused by the fact that the fisheries agreement with Morocco failed to materialise
First and foremost of course the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance which can be used to apply for Community grants for the fleets and the fishermen and shipowners affected
In addition aid can also be granted within the framework of the European Regional Fund the European Social Fund and the European Agricultural Guidance Fund in order to diversify into other activities in the coastal regions affected
In all events we need to start by deciding on the measures and then calculate how much money is needed
And in view of the conclusions of the European Council in Nice the Commission is currently checking if additional funds are available for restructuring the fleets affected within the framework of the current financial perspectives
Commissioner you have not answered my question
The doubts over funding must be cleared up and you must tell us please whether all the funding intended for the fisheries agreement with Morocco EUR million per year will now be invested in the people affected or whether on the contrary quantities will be diverted outside the scope of the fisheries agreement with Morocco
It has been a disaster but that must not mean either a saving or a diversion of the funds which had been already approved
You reply in a theoretical and impersonal way
Please reply specifically to the question you are being asked I asked you what amount are you going to provide
In Andalusia there is enormous concern about this issue
You are an expert in giving no answer but the Commissioner in charge must reply honestly to our questions
It is very easy to avoid the question but you are responsible and you must reply to what you are asked and not in a theoretical and impersonal way
Mr President I think that all in all I have given the honourable Member a very accurate answer although it may not be the answer she wants to hear
However may I clarify exactly what we have to do here
We cannot set a figure and then allow the Spanish to review how the money received is to be disbursed
The legal bases stipulate that we are obliged to do exactly the opposite
First the measures needed because the Morocco agreement failed to materialise must be defined
Then we must stipulate what proportion is to be funded from the existing Regional Fund from the existing Social Fund and from the existing Guidance Fund
If these funds do not suffice then we must consider where we can find the additional funds needed and the Commission is prepared to discuss this
However until we have decided exactly what measures are to be implemented the Commission cannot name an amount
That is a fact
I must also remind you that even the last Morocco agreement contained a reduction in the size of the fleet and that logically not only would we have had to maintain this reduction in any new agreement we would have had to do so with the money currently provided for in the funds
You are wrong to maintain that Spain now has a claim to EUR million per annum because this sum was provided for in the previous agreement on the contrary Spain has a claim to a solution to the problem which has now arisen
What we now have to consider is how much money and what sort of money is needed in order to provide such a solution
That is the correct procedure and there is no alternative to it
Commissioner it is certain that the million euros that there were for chapter IV obviously aimed at Morocco are not going to be used as planned
But if this agreement were going to be for three years those concerned would be expecting million euros from the solidarity of the European Union
We are all aware of this and we hope that the Commission will be generous in paying attention to the petitions from the Governments of Spain and Portugal
We will continue to work towards this in Parliament
But my question has a different aim
I wanted to ask the Commissioner if he is aware of the information that is being published in the Moroccan press at the moment specifically in the weekly Demain and the magazine Economy and Enterprise where top military political and diplomatic figures in Morocco are being accused of having blocked this agreement to protect their own personal interests
It is currently being said in the Moroccan press that they only declare % of their catches and that they are lining their own pockets
This according to what is being said in Morocco at the moment seems to be the real reason
They were not concerned about fishing resources as they told us or the Moroccan fisheries sector or even the Moroccan people but something else
Is the Commission aware of these reports that are being published
They give names
If so is it aware of what is going on and are political economic financial and trade relations with Morocco going to be re-established in the light of what is happening which is just what we suspected and which was the real cause of the failure to cooperate with the European Union
Mr President I did not quite understand from the translation who exactly has been lining their pockets
But I assume that you meant certain Moroccan forces were lining their pockets
Is that correct Mr Varela
I see
I have to say that I am not familiar with the details of the accusations which have been or are being made
But I can assure you that one of the main reasons we said a new agreement had to be set on a new financing basis and a new funding method had to be found was in order to preclude any such suspicions from the outset
That is why we were keen not to do the same in this new agreement as we had in earlier agreements ie to pay out the money without earmarking it for a specific purpose
Part of the negotiations involved earmarking these funds
Then of course the Moroccan side would have had to maintain records of how it had deployed the funds
I think this needs to be the general model for the future
We really cannot agree to provide funds when some or practically all the money paid is clearly being used to develop their own sector without any accounts being rendered as to how these funds have been used
Question No by H
Subject Bilingualism in Istria On April the Regional Council of Istria Croatia adopted a regional statute which provides for parity between Italian and Croatian in all regional institutions and all procedures of administrative bodies
Unfortunately on April these rules were suspended by the Croatian Ministry of Justice which argued that their constitutionality had to be confirmed This is despite the universal view that they are consistent with the spirit and letter of the Croatian constitution or Fundamental Charter
There is great consternation and concern at the serious problems which would be created for the Italian-speaking population given that Italy status as a friendly nation and founder member of the EU should ensure the existence of full ICroatian bilingualism in the border areas
Can the Commission state its views on the compatibility of the negotiations on the association and stability partnership offered by the EU to Croatia with a view to closer relations with this decision by the Croatian government which is visibly contrary to the basic principles of the EU and its acquis and is a clear case of violation of the rights of cultural minorities
As the honourable Member would expect the Commission has been following the recent developments on the bilingual regime in Istria with close interest although the issue has rightly been treated as a bilateral matter by the Italian Government
Protection of minorities through safeguards against discrimination access to education in minority languages and preservation of minority cultures have always been an important element of EU conditionality in our relations with Croatia
Our commitment to such safeguards was reiterated and formalised in the stability and association agreement with Croatia initialled by the Commission on May
Croatia has renewed its commitment to respect its minority population and cultures and the adoption of national legislation supporting the use of minority languages was one of the first achievements of the new Croatian Government last year
Since then the draft of a new comprehensive constitutional law on the protection of minorities has received a favourable opinion from the Council of Europe Venice Commission and work on the issue is continuing
The Commission has every reason to believe that Croatia will apply this legislation seriously
Meanwhile we are looking forward to the opinion of the Croatian Constitutional Court on the Istrian statute
We are confident that Croatia and Italy will find a successful solution to the specific problems referred to in the honourable Member question
Thank you for your response Commissioner
I realise that this is primarily a bilateral issue but we would be grateful if the Council could endeavour to make representations in the appropriate fora to the effect that once the Croatian Constitutional Court has delivered its opinion on the constitutionality of the articles under consideration the Istrian regional statute can at last be reinstated and enter into force in its original form
Mr President Commissioner bilingualism and multilingualism do not just represent a problem in countries wishing to accede to the European Union they also represent an opportunity within the existing Member States
Is there in fact a best practice or a comparison a sort of benchmark between the countries which we can apply in order to identify where the best solutions are being found to the problem and which model has proven to be the best so far
Mr Rübig is right to draw attention to the happy coincidence of languages within communities and countries in the existing Member States
My own nation of Wales is a case in point
I am glad to say that the Welsh language is now increasingly flourishing alongside the dominant English language with advantage for people whose first language is either English or Welsh
That is certainly the case elsewhere in the current Union
I simply hope that those in the Union who would seek to generate divisions on the basis of different cultural and linguistic origins will be overwhelmed by the majority who enjoy the diversity and treasure the co-existence of cultures within the same community
We all appreciate Mr President how difficult it is to exercise your discretion on these occasions
But I have to say on a day when we have had only one hour for questions it was a bit hard that you allowed all the supplementaries to over-run
It becomes a farce if our efforts to hold the Commission to account result in a shortened Question Time and only five questions being asked and answered
Mr MacCormick my understanding of Question Time is that Members must be allowed to ask supplementary questions first
I am amazed at just how detailed the Commission replies have been
It is something which I have never experienced in my years as a Member of this House
I am sure there is a reason for it which I shall ponder on overnight
I am sorry that we have run out of time but these things happen and there is nothing I can do about it
I hope understanding as I do your answer Mr President that I have the good fortune to appear higher on the list the next time you are in the Chair for Question Time
I hope so too
I shall heed your advice Sir and next time I shall be my usual strict self
As we have run out of time for questions to the Commission questions to will be answered in writing
Question time is closed
The sitting was suspended at pm and resumed at pm
Occurrence reporting in civil aviation continuation
The next item is the continuation of the debate on report ­ by Mr Collins on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy Transport and Tourism on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on occurrence reporting in civil aviation [ ­ COD]
Mr President this is the continuation of the debate on Mr Collins report on occurrences in aviation and the reporting thereof
Occurrences can prevent accidents and the duty to report therefore helps increase safety in aviation
By gathering statistical data on the nature and number of certain occurrences existing safety regulations can be improved or new ones introduced
The more information gathered in a broadly-based database the better the analyses
The proposed measure has a strongly preventive character
It is therefore only logical that a legal framework be created at European level
The future European Safety Agency could also stand to benefit from this
The success of the proposed system will depend on the degree of its confidentiality
Detailed information should only end up in the hands of relevant users
Those reporting occurrences must be certain that the information provided will only be used for statistical purposes
After all this is not about apportioning blame or liability
Technical defects tend to be reported more readily than human errors whilst the second category is of major importance where occurrences and hence safety are involved
Pilots for example will only volunteer this information if confidentiality and anonymity are guaranteed
The European Parliament amendments are specifically intended to strengthen this element
The success of the new Regulation will depend on the cooperation of those directly involved That is also evident from the discussions we have held on this platform and in the committee
There is a need for regular evaluation and reporting on the implementation to assess whether the reporting systems work
People in the field need to be involved and that is also the purport of Amendment No which we re-tabled
On the basis of evaluation the lists of occurrences to be reported must be also be updated
However not only do we want to know to what extent occurrences are reported we also want to know the type of occurrences that recur time and again and the safety conclusions that are drawn from these
That is the purport of Amendment No 
In my opinion the public is entitled also to obtain that type of information
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen the liberal group supports the tenor of the rapporteur proposals
How often do I read in the paper that one or other incident has occurred
It is by no means always serious but still
It is therefore in the interest of safety that an effective transparent system be put in place for reporting these incidents at international level so that we can gain an overview and draw lessons from the data gathered
